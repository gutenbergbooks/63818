  <h2 class='c010'>AN APPRECIATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Missionary biography is one of the most interesting
and instructive of studies. It is,
however, a department of missionary literature
to which Americans have not made proportionate
contribution. The foreign missionary Societies of the
United States now represent more missionaries and a
larger expenditure than the European Societies, but
most of the great missionary biographies are of British
and Continental missionaries, so that many Americans
do not realize that there are men connected with their
own Societies whose lives have been characterized by
eminent devotion and large achievement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because I regarded Dr. McGilvary as one of the great
missionaries of the Church Universal, I urged him several
years ago to write his autobiography. He was
then over seventy-five years of age, and I told him that
he could not spend his remaining strength to any better
advantage to the cause he loved than in preparing
such a volume. His life was not only one of unusual
length (he lived to the ripe age of eighty-three), but his
missionary service of fifty-three years covered an interesting
part of the history of missionary work in Siam,
and the entire history, thus far, of the mission to the
Lāo people of northern Siam. There is no more
fascinating story in fiction or in that truth which is
stranger than fiction, than the story of his discovery of
a village of strange speech near his station at Pechaburī,
Siam, his learning the language of the villagers,
his long journey with his friend, Dr. Jonathan Wilson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>into what was then the unknown region of northern
Siam, pushing his little boat up the great river and
pausing not until he had gone six hundred miles northward
and arrived at the city of Chiengmai. The years
that followed were years of toil and privation, of loneliness
and sometimes of danger; but the missionaries
persevered with splendid faith and courage until the
foundations of a prosperous Mission were laid.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all the marked development of the Lāo Mission,
Dr. McGilvary was a leader—the leader. He laid the
foundations of medical work, introducing quinine and
vaccination among a people scourged by malaria and
smallpox, a work which has now developed into five
hospitals and a leper asylum. He began educational
work, which is now represented by eight boarding
schools and twenty-two elementary schools, and is
fast expanding into a college, a medical college, and a
theological seminary. He was the evangelist who won
the first converts, founded the first church, and had a
prominent part in founding twenty other churches,
and in developing a Lāo Christian Church of four
thousand two hundred and five adult communicants.
His colleague, the Rev. Dr. W. C. Dodd, says that Dr.
McGilvary selected the sites for all the present stations
of the Mission long before committees formally sanctioned
the wisdom of his choice. He led the way into
regions beyond and was the pioneer explorer into the
French Lāo States, eastern Burma, and even up to
the borders of China. Go where you will in northern
Siam, or in many sections of the extra-Siamese Lāo
States, you will find men and women to whom Dr. McGilvary
first brought the Good News. He well deserves
the name so frequently given him even in his lifetime—“The
Apostle to the Lāo.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>It was my privilege to conduct our Board’s correspondence
with Dr. McGilvary for more than a decade,
and, in 1902, to visit him in his home and to journey
with him through an extensive region. I have abiding
and tender memories of those memorable days. He
was a Christian gentleman of the highest type, a man
of cultivation and refinement, of ability and scholarship,
of broad vision and constructive leadership. His
evangelistic zeal knew no bounds. A toilsome journey
on elephants through the jungles brought me to a
Saturday night with the weary ejaculation: “Now we
can have a day of rest!” The next morning I slept
late; but Dr. McGilvary did not; he spent an hour before
breakfast in a neighbouring village, distributing
tracts and inviting the people to come to a service at
our camp at ten o’clock. It was an impressive service,—under
a spreading bo tree, with the mighty forest
about us, monkeys curiously peering through the
tangled vines, the huge elephants browsing the bamboo
tips behind us, and the wondering people sitting on
the ground, while one of the missionaries told the
deathless story of redeeming love. But Dr. McGilvary
was not present. Seventy-four years old though he
was, he had walked three miles under a scorching sun
to another village and was preaching there, while Dr.
Dodd conducted the service at our camp. And I said:
“If that is the way Dr. McGilvary rests, what does he
do when he works?” Dr. McKean, his associate of
many years, writes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one who has done country evangelistic work
with Dr. McGilvary can ever forget the oft-seen picture
of the gray-haired patriarch seated on the bamboo floor
of a thatch-covered Lāo house, teaching some one to
read. Of course, the book faced the pupil, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>often said that he had taught so many people in this
way that he could read the Lāo character very readily
with the book upside down. Little children instinctively
loved him, and it is therefore needless to
say that he loved them. In spite of his long snow-white
beard, never seen in men of this land and a
strange sight to any Lāo child, the children readily
came to him. Parents have been led to God because
Dr. McGilvary loved their children and laid his hands
upon them. In no other capacity was the spirit of the
man more manifest than in that of a shepherd. Always
on the alert for every opportunity, counting
neither time nor distance nor the hardship of inclement
weather, swollen streams, pathless jungle, or impassable
road, he followed the example of his Master in
seeking to save the lost. His very last journey, which
probably was the immediate cause of his last illness,
was a long, wearisome ride on horseback, through
muddy fields and deep irrigating ditches, to visit a
man whom he had befriended many years ago and who
seemed to be an inquirer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. McGilvary was pre-eminently a man who walked
with God. His piety was not a mere profession, but a
pervasive and abiding force. He knew no greater joy
than to declare the Gospel of his blessed Lord to the
people to whose up-lifting he had devoted his life.
“If to be great is ‘to take the common things of life
and walk truly among them,’ he was a great man—great
in soul, great in simplicity, great in faith and
great in love. Siam is the richer because Daniel McGilvary
gave her fifty-three years of unselfish service.”
Mrs. Curtis, the gifted author of <i>The Laos of North
Siam</i>, says of Dr. McGilvary: “Neither Carey nor Judson
surpassed him in strength of faith and zeal of purpose;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>neither Paton nor Chalmers has outranked him
in the wonders of their achievements, and not one of
the other hundreds of missionaries ever has had more
evidence of God’s blessing upon their work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not only the missionaries but the Lāo people loved
him as a friend and venerated him as a father. Some
of his intimate friends were the abbots and monks of
the Buddhist monasteries and the high officials of the
country. No one could know him without recognizing
the nobility of soul of this saintly patriarch, in whom
was no guile. December 6th, 1910, many Americans
and Europeans celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his
marriage. The King of Siam through Prince Damrong,
Minister of the Interior, sent a congratulatory
message. Letters, telegrams, and gifts poured in from
many different places. The Christian people of the
city presented a large silver tray, on which was engraved:
“The Christian people of Chiengmai to Dr.
and Mrs. McGilvary, in memory of your having brought
the Gospel of Jesus Christ to us forty-three years ago.”
The tray showed in relief the old rest-house where Dr.
and Mrs. McGilvary spent their first two years in
Chiengmai, the residence which was later their home
of many years, the old dilapidated bridge, and the handsome
new bridge which spans the river opposite the
Christian Girls’ School—thus symbolizing the old and
the new eras.</p>

<p class='c009'>The recent tours of exploration by the Rev. W. Clifton
Dodd, D.D., and the Rev. John H. Freeman have
disclosed the fact that the Lāo peoples are far more
numerous and more widely distributed than we had
formerly supposed. Their numbers are now estimated
at from twelve to sixteen millions, and their habitat
includes not only the Lāo States of northern Siam but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>extensive regions north and northeastward in the Shan
States, Southern China, and French Indo-China. The
evangelization of these peoples is, therefore, an even
larger and more important undertaking than it was
understood to be only a few years ago. All the more
honour, therefore, must be assigned to Dr. McGilvary,
who laid foundations upon which a great superstructure
must now be built.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. McGilvary died as he would have wished to die
and as any Christian worker might wish to die. There
was no long illness. He continued his great evangelistic
and literary labours almost to the end. Only a
short time before his death, he made another of his
famous itinerating journeys, preaching the Gospel to
the outlying villages, guiding perplexed people and
comforting the sick and dying. He recked as little of
personal hardship as he had all his life, thinking
nothing of hard travelling, simple fare, and exposure
to sun, mud, and rain. Not long after his return and
after a few brief days of illness, he quietly “fell on
sleep,” his death the simple but majestic and dignified
ending of a great earthly career.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lāo country had never seen such a funeral as
that which marked the close of this memorable life.
Princes, Governors, and High Commissioners of State
sorrowed with multitudes of common people. The
business of Chiengmai was suspended, offices were
closed, and flags hung at half-mast as the silent form
of the great missionary was borne to its last resting-place
in the land to which he was the first bringer
of enlightenment, and whose history can never be truly
written without large recognition of his achievements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately, Dr. McGilvary had completed this autobiography
before his natural powers had abated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>had sent the manuscript to his brother-in-law, Professor
Cornelius B. Bradley of the University of California.
Dr. Bradley, himself a son of a great missionary
to Siam, has done his editorial work with sympathetic
insight. It has been a labour of love to him to
put these pages through the press, and every friend of
the Lāo people and of Dr. McGilvary is his debtor.
The book itself is characterized by breadth of sympathy,
richness of experience, clearness of statement,
and high literary charm. No one can read these pages
without realizing anew that Dr. McGilvary was a man
of fine mind, close observation, and descriptive gifts.
The book is full of human interest. It is the story of
a man who tells about the things that he heard and
saw and who tells his story well. I count it a privilege
to have this opportunity of commending this volume
as one of the books which no student of southern
Asia and of the missionary enterprise can afford to
overlook.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Years ago, in the absence of any adequate work
upon the subject, the officers of our Missionary
Board and other friends urged me to write a
book on the Lāo Mission. Then there appeared Mrs.
L. W. Curtis’ interesting volume, <i>The Laos of North
Siam</i>, much to be commended for its accuracy and its
valuable information, especially in view of the author’s
short stay in the field. But no such work exhausts its
subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have always loved to trace the providential circumstances
which led to the founding of the Lāo Mission
and directed its early history. And it seems important
that before it be too late, that early history should be
put into permanent form. I have, therefore, endeavoured
to give, with some fulness of detail, the
story of the origin and inception of the Mission, and
of its early struggles which culminated in the Edict
of Religious Toleration. And in the later portions of
the narrative I have naturally given prominence to
those things which seemed to continue the characteristic
features and the personal interest of that earlier
period of outreach and adventure, and especially my
long tours into the “regions beyond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The appearance during the past year of Rev. J. H.
Freeman’s <i>An Oriental Land of the Free</i>, giving very
full and accurate information regarding the present
status of the Mission, has relieved me of the necessity of
going over the same ground again. I have, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>been content to draw my narrative to a close with the
account of my last long tour in 1898.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work was undertaken with many misgivings,
since my early training and the nature of my life-work
have not been the best preparation for authorship.
I cherished the secret hope that one of my own children
would give the book its final revision for the
press. But at last an appeal was made to my brother-in-law,
Professor Cornelius B. Bradley of the University
of California, whose birth and years of service
in Siam, whose broad scholarship, fine literary taste,
and hearty sympathy with our missionary efforts indicated
him as the man above all others best qualified
for this task. His generous acceptance of this work,
and the infinite pains he has taken in the revision and
editing of this book, place me under lasting obligations
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. W. A.
Briggs and to Rev. J. H. Freeman for the use of maps
prepared by them, and to Dr. Briggs and others for the
use of photographs.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>NOTE BY THE EDITOR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The task which has fallen to me in connection
with this book, was undertaken as a labour of
love; and such it seems to me even more, now
that it ends in sadness of farewell. It has not been
an easy task. The vast spaces to be traversed, and
the months of time required before a question could
receive its answer, made consultation with the author
almost impossible. And the ever-present fear that for
him the night might come before the work could receive
a last revision at his hands, or even while he was
still in the midst of his story, led me continually to
urge upon him the need of persevering in his writing—which
was evidently becoming an irksome task—and
on my part to hasten on a piecemeal revision as the
chapters came to hand, though as yet I had no measure
of the whole to guide me.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is, therefore, a great comfort to know that my
urgency and haste were not in vain; that all of the
revision reached him in time to receive his criticism and
correction—though his letter on the concluding chapter
was, as I understand, the very last piece of writing
that he ever did. How serene and bright it was, and
with no trace of the shadow so soon to fall!</p>

<p class='c009'>But the draft so made had far outgrown the possible
limits of publication, and was, of course, without due
measure and proportion of parts. In the delicate task
of its reduction I am much indebted to the kind suggestions
of the Rev. Arthur J. Brown, D.D., and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Rev. A. W. Halsey, D.D., Secretaries of the Board of
Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, and of
the Rev. W. C. Dodd, D.D., of the Lāo Mission, who,
fortunately, was in this country, and who read the
manuscript. For what appears in this book, however,
I alone must assume the responsibility. “An
autobiography is a personal book, expressive of personal
opinion.” And whether we agree with them or
not, the opinions of a man like Dr. McGilvary, formed
during a long lifetime of closest contact with the matters
whereof he speaks, are an essential part not only
of the history of those matters, but of the portrait of
the man, and far more interesting than any mere details
of events or scenes. On all grave questions, therefore,
on which he has expressed his deliberate opinion,
I have preferred to err on the side of inclusion rather
than exclusion.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The plan adopted in this volume for spelling Siamese
and Lāo words is intended to make possible, and even
easy, a real approximation to the native pronunciation.
Only the tonal inflections of native speech and the
varieties of aspiration are ignored, as wholly foreign to
our usage and, therefore, unmanageable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The consonant-letters used and the digraphs <i>ch</i> and
<i>ng</i> have their common English values.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vowels are as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Long ā as in <i>father</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>ē as in <i>they</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>ī as in <i>pique</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>ō as in <i>rode</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>ū as in <i>rude</i>, <i>rood</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>aw as in <i>lawn</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>ê as in <i>there</i> (without the <i>r</i>)</div>
      <div class='line in5'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>ô as in <i>world</i> (without the <i>r</i>)</div>
      <div class='line in5'>û is the <i>high-mixed</i> vowel, not found in English.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>It may be pronounced as u.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Short a as in <i>about</i> (German <i>Mann</i>)—<i>not</i> as in <i>hat</i>.</div>
      <div class='line in5'>e as in <i>set</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>i as in <i>sit</i></div>
      <div class='line in5'>o as in <i>obey</i> (N. Eng. <i>coat</i>)—<i>not</i> as in <i>cot</i>.</div>
      <div class='line in5'>u as in <i>pull</i>, <i>foot</i>—<i>not</i> as in <i>but</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The last four long vowels have also their corresponding
shorts, but since these rarely occur, it has not been
thought worth while to burden the scheme with extra
characters to represent them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The diphthongs are combinations of one of these
vowels, heavily stressed, and nearly always long in
quantity—which makes it seem to us exaggerated or
drawled—with a “vanish” of short <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, (for <i>u</i>), or <i>a</i>.
<i>ai</i> (= English long i, y) and <i>ao</i> (= English <i>ow</i>) are
the only diphthongs with short initial element, and are
to be distinguished from <i>āi</i> and <i>āo</i>. In deference to
long established usage in maps and the like, <i>ie</i> is used
in this volume where <i>ia</i> would be the consistent spelling,
and <i>oi</i> for <i>awi</i>.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>A word remains to be said concerning the name of
the people among whom Dr. McGilvary spent his life.
That name has suffered uncommonly hard usage, especially
at the hands of Americans, as the following brief
history will show. Its original form in European
writing was <i>Lāo</i>, a fairly accurate transcription by
early French travellers of the name by which the
Siamese call their cousins to the north and east. The
word is a monosyllable ending in a diphthong similar
to that heard in the proper names <i>Macāo</i>, <i>Mindanāo</i>,
<i>Callāo</i>. In French writing the name often appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>in the plural form, <i>les Laos</i>; the added <i>s</i>, however, being
silent, made no difference with the pronunciation.
This written plural, then, it would seem, English-speaking
people took over without recognizing the fact
that it was only plural, and made it their standard
form for all uses, singular as well as plural. With
characteristic ignorance or disregard of its proper pronunciation,
on the mere basis of its spelling, they have
imposed on it a barbarous pronunciation of their own—<i>Lay-oss</i>.
It is to be regretted that the usage of American
missionaries has been most effective in giving currency
and countenance to this blunder—has even added
to it the further blunder of using it as the name of the
region or territory, as well as of the people. But the
word is purely ethnical—a proper adjective like our
words <i>French</i> or <i>English</i>, and, like these, capable of
substantive use in naming either the people or their
language, but not their land. Needless to say, these
errors have no currency whatever among European
peoples excepting the English, and they have very little
currency in England. It seems high time for us of
America to amend not only our false pronunciation,
but our false usage, and the false spelling upon which
these rest. In accordance with the scheme of spelling
adopted in this work, the <i>a</i> of the name Lāo is marked
with the macron to indicate its long quantity and
stress.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c010'>I<br /> <br />CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Heredity and early environment exercise such
a determining influence in forming a man’s
character and shaping his destiny that, without
some knowledge of these as a clew, his after-life
would often be unintelligible. And beyond these there
is doubtless a current of events, directing the course
of every man’s life, which no one else can see so clearly
as the man himself. In the following review of my
early life, I have confined myself, therefore, to those
events which seem to have led me to my life-work, or
to have prepared me for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>By race I am a Scotsman of Scotsmen. My father,
Malcom McGilvary, was a Highland lad, born in the
Isle of Skye, and inheriting the marked characteristics
of his race. In 1789, when Malcom was eleven years
old, my grandfather brought his family to the United
States, and established himself in Moore County, North
Carolina, on the headwaters of the Cape Fear River.
The McGilvarys had but followed in the wake of an
earlier immigration of Scottish Highlanders, whose
descendants to this day form a large proportion of the
population of Moore, Cumberland, Richmond, Robeson,
and other counties of North Carolina. My father’s
brothers gradually scattered, one going to the southwestern,
and two to the northwestern frontier. My
father, being the youngest of the family, remained with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>his parents on the homestead. The country was then
sparsely settled; communication was slow and uncertain.
The scattered members of the family gradually
lost sight of one another and of the home. My mother
belonged to the McIver clan—from the same region of
the Scottish Highlands, and as numerous in North
Carolina as the McGilvarys were scarce. She was
born in this country not long after the arrival of her
parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was born May 16th, 1828, being the youngest of
seven children. As soon after my birth as my mother
could endure the removal, she was taken to Fayetteville,
thirty-five miles distant, to undergo a dangerous
surgical operation. The journey was a trying one.
Anæsthetics were as yet unknown. My poor mother
did not long survive the shock. She died on the 23d
of November of that year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since feeding-bottles were not then in use, the
motherless infant was passed around to the care of
aunts and cousins, who had children of like age. Two
aunts in particular, Catharine McIver and Margaret
McNeill, and a cousin, Effie McIver, always claimed a
share in me for their motherly ministrations till, at last,
I could be turned over to my sister Mary. She, though
but six years my senior, was old beyond her years; and
the motherly care with which she watched over her little
charge was long remembered and spoken of in the
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I was four years old, my father married his
second wife, Miss Nancy McIntosh. The next nine
years, till my father’s death, June 8th, 1841, were spent
in the uneventful routine of a godly family in a country
home. My father’s rigid ideas of family discipline
were inherited from his Presbyterian ancestors in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Scotland, and his own piety was of a distinctly old-school
type. He was a ruling elder in the church at
Buffalo, Fayetteville Presbytery, in which office he was
succeeded by my brother, Evander, and three others
of his sons became elders in other churches. No
pressure of business was ever allowed to interfere with
family worship night and morning. A psalm or hymn
from the old village hymnbook always formed part
of the service. My father was an early riser, and, in
the winter time, family worship was often over before
the dawn. Almost every spare moment of his time he
spent in reading Scott’s Family Bible, the Philadelphia
<i>Presbyterian</i>, or one of the few books of devotion which
composed the family library. The special treasure of
the book-case was the great quarto Illustrated Family
Bible, with the Apocrypha and Brown’s Concordance,
published by M. Carey, Philadelphia, 1815. It was the
only pictorial book in the library, and its pictures were
awe-inspiring to us children—especially those in the
Book of Revelation:—The Dragon Chained, The Beast
with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Vision of
the Four Seals. These and the solemn themes of Russell’s
<i>Seven Sermons</i>—which on rainy days I used
to steal away by myself to read—made a profound impression
on me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scottish folk always carry the school with the kirk.
Free schools were unknown; but after the crops were
“laid by,” we always had a subscription school, in
which my father, with his large family, had a leading
interest. The teacher “boarded around” with the
pupils. Our regular night-task was three questions
and answers in the Shorter Catechism—no small task
for boys of ten or twelve years. My memory of the
Catechism once stood me in good stead in after-life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>When examined for licensure by the Orange Presbytery,
I was asked, “What is man’s state by nature?”
In reply I gave the answers to the nineteenth and
twentieth questions in the Catechism. A perceptible
smile passed over the faces of many of the presbyters,
and Father Lynch said, “He is right on the Catechism.
He will pass.” In those days to be “right on the
Catechism” would atone for many failures in Hodge
or Turretin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The church was at the village of Buffalo, four miles
from our home, but no one of the family was expected
to be absent from the family pew on “the Sabbath.”
Carriages were a later luxury in that region. Our two
horses carried father and mother, with the youngest
of the little folks mounted behind, till he should be
able to walk with the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great event of the year was the camp-meeting
at the Fall Communion. It served as an epoch from
which the events of the year before and after it were
dated. For weeks before it came, all work on the
farm was arranged with reference to “Buffalo Sacrament”—pronounced
with long a in the first syllable.
It was accounted nothing for people to come fifteen,
twenty, or even forty miles to the meetings. Every pew-holder
had a tent, and kept open house. No stranger
went away hungry. Neighbouring ministers were invited
to assist the pastor. Services began on Friday,
and closed on Monday, unless some special interest suggested
the wisdom of protracting them further. The
regular order was: A sunrise prayer-meeting, breakfast,
a prayer-meeting at nine, a sermon at ten, an intermission,
and then another sermon. The sermons
were not accounted of much worth if they were not an
hour long. The pulpit was the tall old-fashioned boxpulpit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>with a sounding-board above. For want of
room in the church, the two sermons on Sunday were
preached from a stand in the open air. At the close
of the second sermon the ruling elders, stationed in
various parts of the congregation, distributed to the
communicants the “tokens,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a> which admitted them
to the sacramental table. Then, in solemn procession,
the company marched up the rising ground to the
church, singing as they went:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Children of the Heavenly King,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As ye journey sweetly sing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote c022' id='f1'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “token” was a thin square piece of lead stamped with the
initial letter of the name of the church.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was a beautiful sight, and we boys used to climb the
hill in advance to see it. When the audience was
seated, there was a brief introductory exercise. Then
a hymn was sung, while a group of communicants filled
the places about the communion table. There was
an address by one of the ministers, during the progress
of which the bread and the wine were passed to the
group at the table. Then there was singing again,
while the first group retired, and a second group took
its place. The same ceremony was repeated for them,
and again for others, until all communicants present
had participated. The communion service must have
occupied nearly two hours. One thing I remember
well—when the children’s dinner-time came (which
was after all the rest had dined), the sun was low in
the heavens, and there was still a night service before
us. Notwithstanding some inward rebellion, it seemed
all right then. But the same thing nowadays would
drive all the young people out of the church.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>With some diffidence I venture to make one criticism
on our home life. The “Sabbath” was too
rigidly observed to commend itself to the judgment and
conscience of children—too rigidly, perhaps, for the
most healthy piety in adults. It is hard to convince
boys that to whistle on Sunday, even though the tune
be “Old Hundred,” is a sin deserving of censure. An
afternoon stroll in the farm or the orchard might even
have clarified my father’s vision for the enjoyment of
his Scott’s Bible at night. It would surely have been
a means of grace to his boys. But such was the Scottish
type of piety of those days, and it was strongly
held. The family discipline was of the reserved and
dignified type, rather than of the affectionate. Implicit
obedience was the law for children. My father
loved his children, but never descended to the level
of familiarity with them when young, and could not
sympathize with their sports.</p>

<p class='c009'>But dark days were coming. Brother John Martin
presently married and moved west. In August, 1840,
an infant sister died of quinsy—the first death I ever
witnessed. On June 8th, 1841, the father and “house-bond”
of the family was taken away. The inheritance
he left his children was the example of an upright,
spotless life—of more worth than a legacy of
silver and gold. These we might have squandered, but
that was inalienable.</p>

<p class='c009'>At thirteen, I was small for my age—too small to do
a man’s work on the farm; and there was no money with
which to secure for me an education. Just then occurred
one of those casual incidents which often determine
the whole course of one’s life. Mr. Roderick McIntosh,
one of my mother’s cousins, being disabled for
hard work on the farm, had learned the tailor’s trade,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and was then living in the village of Pittsboro, twenty-one
miles away. His father was a neighbour of ours,
and a man after my father’s own heart. The two families
had thus always been very intimate. While the
question of my destiny was thus in the balance, this
cousin, one day, while on a visit to his father, called at
our house. He had mounted his horse to leave, when,
turning to Evander, he asked, “What is Dan’l going
to do?” My brother replied, “There he is; ask him.”
Turning to me, he said, “Well, Dan’l, how would you
like to come and live with me? I will teach you a
trade.” I had never thought of such a thing, nor had
it ever been mentioned in the family. But somehow it
struck me favourably. Instinctively I replied, “I believe
I should like it.” A life-question could not have
been settled more fortuitously. But it was the first
step on the way to Siam and the Lāo Mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the last day of August, 1841, I bade farewell
to the old home, with all its pleasant associations.
Every spot of it was dear, but never so dear as then.
Accompanied by my brother Evander, each of us riding
one of the old family horses, I started out for my new
home. The departure was not utterly forlorn, since
Evander was still with me. But the parting from him,
as he started back next day, was probably the hardest
thing I had ever experienced. I had to seek a
quiet place and give vent to a flood of tears. For a
time I was inexpressibly sad. I realized, as never before,
that I was cut loose from the old moorings—was
alone in the world. But the sorrows of youth are soon
assuaged. No one could have received a warmer welcome
in the new home than I did. There were two
children in the family, and they helped to fill the void
made by the separation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Pittsboro was not a large village, but its outlook was
broader than that of my home. The world seemed
larger. I myself felt larger than I had done as a
country boy. I heard discussion of politics and of the
questions of the day. The county was strongly Whig,
but Mr. McIntosh was an unyielding Democrat, and as
fond of argument as a politician. According to southern
custom, stores and shops were favourite resorts for
passing away idle time, and for sharpening the wits of
the villagers. The recent Presidential campaign of
1840 furnished unending themes for discussion in our
little shop.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no Presbyterian church in Pittsboro at
that time. The church-going population was divided
between the Methodist and the Episcopalian churches,
the former being the larger. With my cousin’s family
I attended the Methodist church. On my first Sunday
I joined the Methodist Sunday School, and that school
was the next important link in my chain of life. Its
special feature was a system of prizes. A certain number
of perfect answers secured a blue ticket; ten of these
brought a yellow ticket; and yellow tickets, according
to the number of them, entitled the possessor to various
prizes—a hymnbook, a Bible, or the like. On the
first Sunday I was put into a class of boys of my
own age, at work on a little primer of one hundred
and six questions, all answered in monosyllables. By
the next Sunday I was able to recite the whole, together
with the Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’ Creed
at the end. It was no great feat; but the teacher and
the school thought it was. So, on the strength of
my very first lesson, I got a yellow ticket, and was
promoted to the next higher class. That stimulated
my ambition, and I devoted my every spare hour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>study. The next book was one of questions and answers
on the four Gospels. They were very easy; I
was able to commit to memory several hundred answers
during the week. In a few Sundays I got my first
prize; and it was not long before I had secured all the
prizes offered in the school. What was of far more
value than the prizes was the greater love for study
and for the Scriptures which the effort had awakened
in me, and a desire for an education. The shop was
often idle; I had plenty of time for study, and made
the most of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At one of the subsequent Quarterly Meetings, a Rev.
Mr. Brainard, who had considerable reputation as a
revivalist, preached one Sunday night a vivid and
thrilling sermon on Noah’s Ark and the Flood. So
marked was the impression on the audience, that, at
the close, according to the Methodist custom, “mourners”
were invited to the altar. Many accepted the invitation.
A young friend sitting beside me was greatly
affected. With streaming eyes he said, “Dan’l, let us
go, too,” rising up and starting as he spoke. After
a few moments I followed. By this time the space
about the altar was well filled. There was great excitement
and no little confusion—exhortation, singing, and
prayer going on all at once. A number of persons
made profession of religion, and soon my young friend
joined them. He was full of joy, and was surprised
to find that I was not so, too. The meetings were continued
night after night, and each night I went to the
altar. As I look back upon it from this distance, it
seems to me that, with much exhortation to repent
and believe, there was not enough of clear and definite
instruction regarding the plan of salvation, or the offices
and work of Christ. One night, in a quiet hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>at home, the grounds and method of a sinner’s acceptance
of Christ became clear to me, and He became
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after, when invitation was given to the new converts
to join the church as probationers, I was urged
by some good friends to join with the rest; and was
myself not a little inclined to do so. It was no doubt
the influence of my cousin that enabled me to withstand
the excitement of the revival and the gentle
pressure of my Methodist friends, and to join, instead,
my father’s old church at Buffalo. But I owe more
than I shall ever know to that Sunday School, and
since then I have always loved the Methodist Church.
Meanwhile the prospects for an education grew no
brighter, though Mr. Brantley, then a young graduate
in charge of the Pittsboro Academy, but afterward a
distinguished Baptist minister of Philadelphia, gave
me a place in his school at idle times; and a Dr. Hall
used to lend me books to read.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the opportunity for acquiring an education
finally came, it was as unexpected as a clap of thunder
out of a blue sky. The celebrated Bingham School,
now in Asheville, North Carolina, was then, as now, the
most noted in the South. It was started by Rev. William
Bingham in Pittsboro, North Carolina, in the
closing years of the eighteenth century. It was moved
to Hillsboro by his son, the late William J. Bingham,
father of the present Principal. The school was
patronized by the leading families of the South. The
number of pupils was strictly limited. To secure a
place, application had to be made a year or more in
advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>My surprise, therefore, can well be imagined, when
one day Baccus King, a young boy of the town, walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>into the shop with a letter addressed to Master Daniel
McGilvary from no less a personage than William J.
Bingham, the great teacher and Principal. At first I
thought I was the victim of some boyish trick. But
there was the signature, and the explanation that followed
removed all doubt. Nathan Stedman, an influential
citizen of Pittsboro, was an early acquaintance
and friend of Mr. Bingham. He had visited the school
in person to secure a place for his nephew, young
King, and had brought back with him the letter for
me. What Mr. Bingham knew of me I never discovered.
No doubt Mr. Stedman could have told,
though up to that time I had never more than spoken
with him. Be that as it may, there was the letter
with its most generous offer that I take a course in
Bingham School at the Principal’s expense. He was
to board me and furnish all necessary expenses, which,
after graduation, I was to refund by teaching. If I
became a minister of the Gospel, the tuition was to be
free; otherwise I was to refund that also. To young
King’s enquiry what I would do, I replied, “Of course,
I shall go.” My cousin, Mr. McIntosh, was scarcely
less delighted than I was at the unexpected opening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The invitation to attend Bingham School came in
the fall of 1845, when I was in my eighteenth year.
There were then only two weeks till the school should
open. I had little preparation to make. A pine box
painted red was soon got ready to serve as a trunk, for
my wardrobe was by no means elaborate. Mr. Stedman
kindly offered me a seat with Baccus and a friend
of his who was returning to the school. On the way
Baccus’ friend entertained us with stories of the rigid
discipline, for this was in the days when the rod was
not spared. I had no fears of the rod, but I trembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>lest I should not sustain myself as well as such great
kindness demanded. It might be a very different thing
from winning a reputation in a Methodist Sunday
School.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dusk when we reached The Oaks. The family
was at supper. Mr. Bingham came out to receive
us. He told Baccus’ friend to take him to his own old
quarters, and, turning to me, said, “I have made arrangements
for you to board with Mr. C., and to room
with Mr. K., the assistant teacher, till my house is finished,
when you are to live with us. But we are at
supper now. You must be hungry after your long
ride. Come in and eat with us.” After supper, Mr.
Bingham went with me to my boarding-house, and
introduced me to my hosts and to my chum, David
Kerr. He welcomed me, and said he thought we
should get along finely together. We not only did
that, but he became a warm friend to whom I owed
much. So I was in the great Bingham School, overwhelmed
with a succession of unexpected kindnesses
from so many quarters! What did it all mean?</p>
<div id='i030'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>WILLIAM J. BINGHAM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>My highest anticipations of the school were realized.
If there ever was a born teacher, William J. Bingham
was one. Latin and Greek were taught then by a
method very different from the modern one. Before a
sentence was read or translated, the invariable direction
was—master your grammar. In grammar-drill
Mr. Bingham could have no superior. Bullion’s
Grammars and Readers were the text-books. The principal
definitions were learned practically verbatim.
The coarse print was required of all in the class. The
older pupils were advised to learn notes, exceptions,
and all. I never became so familiar with any other
books as with that series of grammars. We were expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to decline every noun and adjective, alone or
combined, from nominative singular to ablative plural,
backwards or forwards, and to give, at a nod, voice,
mood, tense, number, and person of any verb in the
lesson. These exercises became at last so easy that
they were great fun. Even now, sixty years later, I
often put myself to sleep by repeating the old paradigms.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may seem that my estimate of Mr. Bingham is
prejudiced by my sense of personal obligation to him
for his kindness. Yet I doubt not that the universal
verdict of every one who went there to study would
be that he should be rated as one of the world’s
greatest teachers. The South owes much to him for
the dignity he gave to the profession of teaching. No
man ever left a deeper impress on me. Thousands of
times I have thanked the Lord for the opportunity to
attend his school.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was graduated from the school in May, 1849, a few
days before I was twenty-one years old. On leaving
my kind friends at The Oaks, I was again at sea. It
will be remembered that, by my original agreement, I
was booked for teaching—but I had no idea where.
Once more the unexpected happened. In the midst
of negotiations for a school in the southern part of
the state, I was greatly surprised at receiving an offer
from one of the prominent business men of my own
town, Pittsboro, to assist me in organizing a new
school of my own there. With much doubt and hesitation
on my part—for there were already two preparatory
schools in the place—the venture was made, and
I began with ten pupils taught in a little business office.
The number was considerably increased during
the year. But when the second year opened, I was put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in charge of the Academy, whose Principal had resigned.
Here, in work both pleasant and fairly profitable,
I remained until the four years for which I had
agreed to stay were up.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had by no means reached my ideal. But, as my
friends had predicted, it had been a success. Some
of my warmest supporters were sure that I was giving
up a certainty for an uncertainty, in not making
teaching my life-work. It had evidently been the
hope of my friends from the first that I would make
Pittsboro my home, and build up a large and permanent
school there. But my purpose of studying for
the ministry had never wavered, and that made it
easier for me to break off.</p>

<p class='c009'>During these four years my relations with the newly
organized Presbyterian church had been most pleasant
and profitable. There was no resisting the appeal
that I should become ruling elder. The superintendency
of the Sunday School also fell naturally to me,
and opened up another field of usefulness. The friendship
formed with the pastor, the Rev. J. H. McNeill,
is one of the pleasant memories of my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>One feature of the church connection must not be
passed over. Neither of the other elders was so circumstanced
as to be able to attend the meetings of the
Orange Presbytery. Three of the leading professors
in the University were members of the Presbytery, and
all the leading schools within its bounds were taught
by Presbyterian ministers or elders. To accommodate
this large group of teachers, the meetings were held in
midsummer and midwinter. Thus it fell to my lot to
represent the Pittsboro church at the Presbytery during
nearly the whole of the four years of my stay in
Pittsboro. As it was then constituted, its meetings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>were almost equal to a course in church government.
The Rev. J. Doll, one of the best of parliamentarians,
was stated clerk. A group of members such as the
two Drs. Phillips, father and son, Dr. Elisha Mitchell,
of the University, and many others that could be
named, would have made any assembly noted. Professor
Charles Phillips, as chairman of the committee
on candidates for the ministry, came into closer touch
with me than most of the others. He afterwards followed
my course in the Seminary with an interest
ripening into a friendship which continued throughout
his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meetings of the Presbytery were not then
merely formal business meetings. They began on
Wednesday and closed on Monday. They were looked
forward to by the church in which they were to be
held as spiritual and intellectual feasts. To the members
themselves they were seasons of reunion, where
friendships were cemented, and where wits were sharpened
by intellectual conflicts, often before crowded congregations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Union Seminary, now of Richmond, Virginia, has
always been under the direction of the Synods of North
Carolina and Virginia; and there were strong reasons
why students from those Synods should study there.
They were always reminded of that obligation. But
the high reputation of Drs. Hodge and Alexander was
a strong attraction toward Princeton. My pastor and
Professor Phillips, chairman of the committee in charge
of me, had both studied there. So I was allowed
to have my preference. No doubt this proved another
stepping-stone to Siam. Union Seminary was not then
enthusiastic in regard to foreign missions, as it has
since become. At the last meeting of Presbytery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that I was to attend, Dr. Alexander Wilson moved that,
inasmuch as Orange Presbytery owned a scholarship in
Princeton Seminary, I be assigned to it. To my objection
that I had made money to pay my own way,
he replied, “You will have plenty of need of your
money. You can buy books with it.” I followed the
suggestion and laid in a good library.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c010'>II<br /> <br />MINISTERIAL TRAINING</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>I entered Princeton Seminary in the fall of
1853. I did not lodge in the Seminary building,
but, through the kindness of Rev. Daniel
Derouelle—whom, as agent of the American Bible Society,
I had come to know during his visits to Pittsboro—I
found a charming home in his family. There
were, of course, some disadvantages in living a mile
and a half away from the Seminary. I could not have
the same intimate relations with my fellow students
which I might have had if lodged in the Seminary.
But I had the delightful home-life which most of them
missed altogether. And the compulsory exercise of
two, or sometimes three, trips a day, helped to keep
me in health throughout my course. I became, indeed,
a first-rate walker—an accomplishment which has since
stood me in good stead in all my life abroad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being from the South, and not a college graduate, as
were most of the students, I felt lonesome enough
when, on the first morning of the session, I entered
the Oratory and looked about me without discovering
a single face that I knew. But at the close of the
lecture some one who had been told by a friend to look
out for me, touched me on the shoulder, made himself
known, and then took me off to introduce me to J.
Aspinwall Hodge, who was to be a classmate of mine.
No man ever had a purer or a better friend than this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>young man, afterward Dr. J. Aspinwall Hodge; and
I never met a friend more opportunely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of our revered teachers and of the studies of the
Seminary course there is no need to speak here. Our
class was a strong one. Among its members were such
men as Gayley, Mills, Jonathan Wilson, Nixon, Lefevre,
and Chaney. Of these Gayley and Mills were already
candidates for missionary work abroad. In other
classes were Robert McMullen and Isidore Loewenthal,
destined to become martyrs in Cawnpore and
Peshawur. Many were the stirring appeals we heard
from these men. Dr. Charles Hodge, too, had given a
son to India; and he never spoke more impressively
than when he was pleading the cause of foreign missions.
Princeton, moreover, because of its proximity
to New York and to the headquarters of the various
missionary societies established there, was a favourite
field for the visits of the Secretaries of these organizations,
and of returned missionaries. A notable visit
during my first year was that of Dr. Alexander Duff,
then in his prime. No one who heard him could forget
his scathing criticism of the church for “playing at
missions,” or his impassioned appeals for labourers.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the question was kept constantly before me. But
during the first two years, the difficulty of the acquisition
of a foreign language by a person not gifted in
his own, seemed an obstacle well-nigh insuperable.
Conscience suggested a compromise. Within the field
of Home Missions was there not equal need of men
to bring the bread of life to those who were perishing
without it? With the object of finding some such opportunity,
I spent my last vacation, in the summer of
1855, in Texas as agent of the American Sunday School
Union.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Texas afforded, indeed, great opportunities for Christian
work; but in the one object of my quest—a field
where Christ was not preached—I was disappointed.
In every small village there was already a church—often
more than one. Even in country schoolhouses
Methodists, Baptists, and Cumberland Presbyterians
had regular Sunday appointments, each having acquired
claim to a particular Sunday of the month.
Conditions were such that the growth of one sect usually
meant a corresponding weakening of the others.
It was possible, of course, to find local exceptions.
But it is easier even now to find villages by the hundred,
with three, four, and even five Protestant
churches, aided by various missionary societies; where
all the inhabitants, working together, could do no more
than support one church well. This may be necessary;
but it is surely a great waste.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this trip I had just returned with these
thoughts in my mind, and was entering upon my senior
year, when it was announced that Dr. S. R. House, a
missionary from Siam, would address the students.
Expectation was on tiptoe to hear from this new
kingdom of Siam. The address was a revelation to us
all. The opening of the kingdom to American missionaries
by the reigning monarch, Mahā Mongkut—now
an old story—was new then, and sounded like a
veritable romance. My hesitation was ended. Here
was not merely a village or a parish, but a whole
kingdom, just waking from its long, dark, hopeless
sleep. Every sermon I preached there might be to
those who had never heard that there is a God in heaven
who made them, or a Saviour from sin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The appeal was for volunteers to go at once. None,
however, of the men who had announced themselves as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>candidates for service abroad were available for Siam.
They were all pledged to other fields. The call found
Jonathan Wilson and myself in much the same state
of expectancy, waiting for a clear revelation of duty.
After anxious consultation and prayer together, and
with Dr. House, we promised him that we would give
the matter our most serious thought. If the Lord
should lead us thither, we would go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the Rev. Andrew B. Morse had been appointed
a missionary to Siam, and the immediate
urgency of the case was thus lightened. Shortly before
the close of my Seminary course, in 1856, there
came to me a call to the pastorate of two contiguous
churches, those of Carthage and of Union, in my native
county in North Carolina. The call seemed a providential
one, and I accepted it for one year only. My
classmate, Wilson, soon after accepted a call to work
among the Indians in Spencer Academy.</p>

<p class='c009'>My parish was an admirable one for the training of
a young man. The church at Union was one of the
oldest in the state. The church at Carthage, five
miles away, was a colony from Union. No distinct
geographical line separated the two. Many of the
people regularly attended both. That, of course, made
the work harder for a young pastor. The extreme
limits of the two parishes were fifteen miles apart.
But these were church-going folk, mostly of Scottish
descent—not “dry-weather Christians.” The pastorate
had been vacant a whole year.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the first morning service the church was crowded
to its utmost capacity. Some came, no doubt, from
curiosity to hear the new preacher; but most of them
were hungry for the Gospel. They had all known
my father; and some had known me—or known of me—from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>boyhood. I could not have had a more sympathetic
audience, as I learned from the words of appreciation
and encouragement spoken to me after
church—especially those spoken by my brother, who
was present.</p>

<p class='c009'>The year passed rapidly. The work had prospered
and was delightful. In it I formed the taste for
evangelistic touring, which was afterwards to be my
work among the Lāo. There had been a number of
accessions in both churches. It was easy to become
engrossed in one’s first charge among a people so sympathetic,
and to overlook far-away Siam. Indeed, I
had become so far influenced by present surroundings
as to allow my name to be laid before a meeting
of the congregation with a view to becoming their
permanent pastor. Their choice of me was unanimous.
Moreover, I had been dismissed from my old Presbytery
to the one within whose bounds my parish
was. The regular meeting of the latter was not far
off, when arrangements were to be made for my ordination
and installation.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the time drew near, do what I might, my joy
in accepting the call seemed marred by the thought
of Siam. I learned that the Siamese Mission, instead
of growing stronger, was becoming weaker. Mr.
Morse’s health had completely broken down during
his first year in the field. He was then returning to
the United States. Mrs. Mattoon had already come
back an invalid. Her husband, after ten years in
Siam, was greatly in need of a change; but was
holding on in desperation, hoping against hope that
he might be relieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question of my going to Siam, which had been
left an open one, must now soon be settled by my accepting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>or declining. I needed counsel, but knew not
on what earthly source to call. When the question of
Siam first came up in Princeton, I had written to leading
members of the Orange Presbytery for advice, stating
the claims of Siam so strongly that I was sure
these men would at least give me some encouragement
toward going. But the reply I had from one of them
was typical of all the rest: “We do not know about
Siam; but we do know of such and such a church
and of such and such a field vacant here in Orange
Presbytery. Still, of course, it <i>may</i> be your duty to
go to Siam.” In that quarter, surely, there was no
light for me. So I devoted Saturday, August 1st, to
fasting and prayer for guidance. In the woods back
of the Carthage church and the Academy, the decision
was finally reached. I would go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning I stopped my chief elder on his way
to church, and informed him of my decision. After
listening to my statement of the case, he replied, “Of
course, if it is settled, there’s nothing more to be said.”
It chanced that Mr. Russell, my former assistant in
the Pittsboro Academy, had just finished his theological
course; and, wholly without reference to the
question pending in my mind, had arranged to preach
for me that day. The session was called together before
service, was notified of my decision, and was reminded
that the preacher of the day would be available
as a successor to me. He preached a good sermon,
had a conference with the session afterwards, and
was virtually engaged that day. The following week
brought notice of my appointment as missionary to
Siam.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last communion season of that year was one of
more than usual interest. The meetings began on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Friday. Since the minds of the congregation were
already on the subject of foreign missions, and since
Dr. McKay, from my home church, had been appointed
by the Synod to preach on that subject at its coming
session in Charlotte, I prevailed upon him to preach
to us the sermon that he had prepared. The text was
from Romans x:14, “How shall they hear without a
preacher?” No subject could have been more appropriate
to the occasion. It produced a profound
impression. Some were affected to tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sermon was a good preparation for the communion
service that followed. At the night service
there was deep seriousness throughout the congregation,
and a general desire to have the meetings continued.
On Monday there was an unexpectedly large
congregation. At the busiest season of the year farmers
had left their crops to come. The meetings soon
grew to be one protracted prayer-meeting, with occasional
short applications of Scripture to the questions
which were already pressing upon our minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, after the meetings had been continued from
Friday until Wednesday week, they were reluctantly
brought to a close; both because it seemed unwise to
interrupt longer the regular life of the community,
and also because the leaders no longer had the voice
to carry them on. As a result of the meetings, there
were about eighty accessions to the two Presbyterian
churches, as well as a number to other churches. Many
asked if I did not see in the revival reason to change
my mind and remain. But the effect on me was just
the opposite. It was surely the best preparation I
could have had for the long test of faith while waiting
for results in Siam.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inasmuch as my certificate of dismissal had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>been formally presented to the Fayetteville Presbytery,
I preferred to return it to my old Orange Presbytery,
and to receive my ordination at its hands. On December
11th, the Presbytery met at my old home in
Pittsboro. The installation of a foreign missionary
was new to the Presbytery, as well as to the church
and the community. When the ordaining prayer was
ended, there seemed to be but few dry eyes in the congregation.
It was a day I had little dreamed of sixteen
years before, when I first came to Pittsboro an
orphan boy and an apprentice. I felt very small for
the great work so solemnly committed to me. Missionary
fields were further off in those days than they
are now, and the undertaking seemed greater. The
future was unknown; but in God was my trust—and
He has led me.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>On reaching New York I went directly to the
Mission House, then at 23 Centre Street. As I
mounted the steps, the first man I met on the
landing was Jonathan Wilson. We had exchanged a
few letters, and each knew that the other had not forgotten
Siam; but neither expected to meet the other
there. “Where are you going?” said one. “I am
on my way to Siam,” said the other. “So am I,”
was the reply. In the meantime he had married and,
with his young wife, was in New York awaiting
passage. We took the first opportunity that offered,
the clipper ship <i>David Brown</i>, bound for Singapore,
and sailing on March 11th, 1858.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sailors have a tradition that it is unlucky to have
missionaries on board; but the weather was propitious
throughout, and the voyage a prosperous one. We
three were the only passengers, and we proved to be
good sailors. Our fare was reasonably good. We
had plenty of good reading, and soon settled down to
steady work. The ship was somewhat undermanned;
and this fact was given as an excuse for not having
service on Sundays. But we had a daily prayer-meeting
throughout the voyage, with just a sufficient number
present to plead the promise: “Where two or three
are gathered together in my name.” We also had
free access to the men in the forecastle when off duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had the excitement of an ocean race with a twin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ship of the same line, which was to sail a week after
us. As we reached Anjer Straits on the seventy-eighth
day out, a sail loomed up which proved to be our competitor.
She had beaten us by a week! Ten days
later we reached Singapore, where, indeed, we met no
brethren, but were met by welcome letters from Siam.
Like Paul at the Three Taverns, “we thanked God and
took courage.” One of the letters ran thus:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Those were good words that came to our half-discouraged
band—the tidings that we are to have helpers in our
work.... In our loneliness we have sometimes been
tempted to feel that our brethren at home had forgotten
us. But we rejoice to know that there are hearts in the
church which sympathize with us, and that you are willing
to come and participate with us in our labours and trials,
our joys and sorrows, for we have both.”</p>

<p class='c025'>We were fortunate to secure very early passage for
Bangkok. On Friday, June 18th, we reached the bar
at the mouth of the Mênam River. The next day we
engaged a small schooner to take us up to Bangkok.
With a strong tide against us, we were not able that
evening to get further than Mosquito Point—the most
appropriately-named place in all that land—only to
learn that we could not reach Bangkok until Monday
afternoon. There was no place to sleep on board; and
no sleeping would have been possible, had there been
a place. By two o’clock in the morning we could
endure it no longer;—the mosquito contest was too
unequal. At last we found a man and his wife who
would take us to the city in their two-oared skiff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fifty years’ residence in Siam has not surpassed the
romance of that night’s ride. Leaving our goods behind,
we seated ourselves in the tiny craft. With gunwales
but two inches above the water’s edge, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>skimmed along through a narrow winding canal overhung
with strange tropical trees. The moon was full,
but there was a haze in the air, adding weirdness to
things but dimly seen. The sight of our first Buddhist
monastery, with its white columns and grotesque figures,
made us feel as if we were passing through some
fairyland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at dawn on Sunday morning, June 20th, 1858,
we landed at the mission compound. Our quick
passage of only one hundred days took our friends by
surprise. Dr. House, roused by our voices on the
veranda, came <i>en déshabillé</i> to the door to see what
was the matter. Finding who we were, the eager man
thrust his hand through a vacant square of the sash,
and shook hands with us so, before he would wait to
open the door. We were in Bangkok! It was as if
we had waked up in a new world—in the Bangkok to
which we had looked forward as the goal of our hopes;
which was to be, as we supposed, the home of our lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. Mr. Mattoon was still at his post, awaiting
our coming. Mrs. Mattoon and her daughters had
been compelled to leave for home some time before our
arrival. And not long thereafter Mr. Mattoon followed
them on his furlough, long overdue. Besides
the two men of our own mission, we found in Bangkok
the Rev. Dan B. Bradley, M.D., who was conducting
a self-supporting mission; Rev. S. J. Smith, and Rev.
R. Telford of the Baptist mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since neither Bangkok nor Lower Siam proved to
be my permanent home, I shall content myself with a
very summary account of the events of the next three
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first work of a new missionary is to acquire the
language of the country. His constant wish is, Oh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>for a gift of tongues to speak to the people! As soon
as a teacher could be found, I settled to work at my
<i>kaw</i>, <i>kā</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>kī</i><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. No ambitious freshman has such an
incentive for study as has the new missionary. It is
well if he does not confine himself to grammar and
dictionary, as he did in the case of his Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew. Pallegoix’s <i>Dictionarium Linguae Thai</i>,
and his short <i>Grammar</i> in Latin, were all the foreign
helps we had. The syntax of the language is easy;
but the “tones,” the “aspirates,” and “inaspirates,”
are perplexing beyond belief. You try to say “fowl.”
No, that is “egg.” You mean to say “rice,” but you
actually say “mountain.”</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f2'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first exercise of the Siamese Spelling-book.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A thousand times a day the new missionary longs to
open his mouth, but his lips are sealed. It is a matter
of continual regret that he cannot pour out his
soul in the ardour of his first love, unchilled by the
deadening influences to which it is sure to be subjected
later. But the delay is not an unmitigated
evil. He is in a new world, in which he is constantly
reminded of the danger of giving offence by a breach
of custom as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and
Persians. A bright little boy runs up and salutes you.
You stroke his long black hair, only to be reminded
by one of your seniors—“Oh! you must <i>never</i> do that!
It is a mortal offence to lay your hand on a person’s
head.” So, while you are learning the language, you
are learning other things as well, and of no less importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the mission school there was a class of bright
boys named Nê, Dit, Chûn, Kwāi, Henry, and one
girl, Tūan. To my great delight, Dr. House kindly
turned them over to me. It made me think I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>doing something, and I really was. I soon became
deeply interested in these children. Nê grew to be an
important business man and an elder in the church;
Tūan’s family became one of the most influential in
the church. Her two sons, the late Bun It and Elder
Bun Yī of the First Church in Chiengmai, have been
among the very best fruits of the mission; though my
personal share in their training was, of course, very
slight. In the September after our arrival there was
organized the Presbytery of Siam, with the four men
of the mission as its constituent members. During the
first two years, moreover, I made a number of tours
about the country—sometimes alone, oftener with Dr.
House, and once with Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had the pleasure of meeting His Majesty the King
of Siam, not only at his birthday celebrations, to
which foreigners were invited, but once, also, at a
public audience on the occasion of the presentation
of a letter from President James Buchanan of the
United States. This was through the courtesy of Mr.
J. H. Chandler, the acting United States Consul. Two
royal state barges were sent down to the Consulate to
receive the President’s letter and the consular party.
Siamese etiquette requires that the letter be accorded
the same honour as would be given the President in person.
In the first barge was the letter, placed in a
large golden urn, with a pyramidal cover of gold, and
escorted by the four officers who attend upon His
Majesty when he appears in public. In the second
barge was the consular party.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a magnificent ride of four miles up the river,
we were met at the palace by gilded palanquins for
the members of the party, while the letter, in a special
palanquin and under the golden umbrella, led the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to the Palace, some quarter of a mile distant. At the
Palace gate a prince of rank met us, and ushered us
into the royal presence, where His Majesty sat on his
throne of gold, richly overhung with gilded tapestry.
Advancing toward the throne, and bowing low, we
took our stand erect, while every high prince and nobleman
about us was on bended knees, not daring to raise
his eyes above the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Consul then read a short introductory speech,
stepped forward, and placed the letter in the extended
hands of the King. Having glanced over it, the King
handed it to his secretary, who read it aloud, His
Majesty translating the substance of it to the princes
and nobles present. The King then arose, put his
scarf about his waist, girded on his golden sword,
came down, and shook hands with each of the party.
Then, with a wave of his hand, he said, “We have given
President Buchanan the first public reception in our
new palace,” adding, “I honour President Buchanan
very much.” He escorted the party around the room,
showing us the portraits of George Washington, President
Pierce, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert. Then,
turning to the proper officer, he directed him to conduct
us to an adjoining room to partake of a luncheon
prepared for us; and, with a bow, withdrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>After “tiffin,” we were escorted to the landing as
we had come, and returned in like state in the royal
barge to the Consulate. Altogether it was a notable
occasion.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of the tours undertaken in Lower Siam, the one
which led to the most lasting results was one in 1859
to Pechaburī, which has since become well known as
one of our mission stations. For companion on this
trip I had Cornelius Bradley, son of the Rev. Dr. Bradley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Bangkok. Shortly before this a rising young
nobleman, and a liberal-minded friend of foreigners,
had been assigned to the place ostensibly of lieutenant-governor
(Pra Palat) of Pechaburī, but practically of
governor. He was a brother of the future Regent;
had been on the first embassy to England; and at a
later period became Minister for Foreign Affairs. At
our call, His Excellency received us very kindly, and
before we left invited us to dine with him on the
following evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dinner was one that would have done credit to
any hostess in America. I was still more surprised
when, at the table, addressing me by a title then given
to all missionaries, he said, “Maw” (Doctor), “I
want you to come and live in Pechaburī. You have
no family. I will furnish you a house, and give you
every assistance you need. You can teach as much
Christianity as you please, if only you will teach my
son English. If you want a school, I will see that
you have pupils.” I thanked him for the offer, but
could only tell him that I would think the matter over.
It might be, after all, only a Siamese cheap compliment.
It seemed too good to be true. It was, however,
directly in the line of my own thoughts. I had
come to Siam with the idea of leaving the great commercial
centres, and making the experiment among a
rural population like that of my North Carolina
charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day the Pra Palat called on us at our
<i>sālā</i>,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and again broached the subject. He was very
anxious to have his son study English. In my mission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>work I should be untrammelled. Before leaving us, he
mentioned the matter again. It was this time no
courteous evasion when I told him I would come if I
could.—What did it all mean?</p>

<p class='c009'>I returned to Bangkok full of enthusiasm for
Pechaburī. The more I pondered it, the greater the
offer seemed to be. Beyond my predilection for a
smaller city or for rural work, I actually did not like
Bangkok. Pechaburī, however, was beyond the limits
of treaty rights. Permission to establish a station
there could be had only by sufferance from a government
not hitherto noted for liberality. Here was an
invitation equivalent to a royal permit, and with no
further red tape about it. I could see only one obstacle
in the way. The senior member of the mission—the
one who was naturally its head—I feared would
not approve. And he did, indeed, look askance at the
proposition. He doubted whether we could trust the
promises made. And then to go so far away alone!
But I thought I knew human nature well enough to
trust that man. As to being alone, I was willing to
risk that. Possibly it might not be best to ride a
free horse too freely. I would go with my own equipment,
and be at least semi-independent; though the
Palat had said that he did not mind the expense, if
only he could get his son taught English.</p>

<p class='c009'>There could at least be no objection to making an
experimental visit, and then continuing it as long as
might seem wise. Pechaburī is within thirty hours
of Bangkok. If taken sick, I could run over in a day
or two. With that understanding, and with the tacit
rather than the expressed sanction of the mission, I
began to make preparations.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last my preparations were complete, even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>baking bread for the trip. I had fitted up a touring-boat
of my own, and had engaged captain and boatmen;
when, on the day before I was to start, cholera,
which for some time had been sporadic in Bangkok,
suddenly became epidemic. Till then Dr. James Campbell,
physician to the British Consulate, and our medical
authority, thought that with caution and prudence
I might safely go. A general panic now arose all
over the land. Dr. Bradley came to tell me that
deaths were occurring hourly on the canal by which
I was to travel. To go then would be to tempt providence.
I had earnestly sought direction, and it came
in a way little expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first man I met next morning was Dr. House,
coming home from Mr. Wilson’s. He had been called
in the night to attend Mrs. Wilson, who had been suddenly
attacked with “the disease,” as the natives
euphemistically call it, being superstitiously afraid
of uttering the name. Dr. House had failed to check
it, and sent me to call Dr. Campbell. But he was not
at home, and did not get the message till near noon.
By that time the patient had reached the stage when
collapse was about to ensue. The disease was finally
arrested, but Mrs. Wilson was left in a very precarious
condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile her little daughter Harriet was also taken
ill, and for a time the life of both mother and daughter
was in suspense. The child lingered on till May 13th,
when she was taken to a better clime. On July 14th the
mother, too, ceased from her suffering, and entered on
her everlasting rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>During these months, of course, all thoughts of
Pechaburī had been abandoned; nor would it then
have been deemed wise to travel during the wet season.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Before the next dry season came, Bangkok began
to have more attractions, and I had become less
ambitious to start a new station alone. On the 11th
of September I became engaged to Miss Sophia Royce
Bradley, daughter of the Rev. D. B. Bradley, M.D.
On December 6th, 1860, we were married. In my
wife I found a helpmeet of great executive ability, and
admirably qualified for the diversified work before us.
It was something, too, to have inherited the best traditions
of one of the grand missionaries of his age.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c020'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f4'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Bradley’s life would be the best history we could have of
Siam during its transition period. He left a voluminous diary, and
it was from his pen that most of the exact information concerning
Siam was long derived.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Samrē, our mission station in Bangkok, was four
miles distant from the heart of the city. We greatly
needed a more central station for our work. Dr.
Bradley offered us the use of a house on his own
premises—one of the most desirable situations in
Bangkok—if we would come and live there. The mission
accepted his generous offer. With reluctance I
resigned whatever claim I might have to be the pioneer
of the new station at Pechaburī. We were settled, as
it would seem, for life, in Bangkok.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c010'>IV<br /> <br />PECHABURĪ—THE CALL OF THE NORTH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>By this time the mission generally had become
interested in the establishment of a new station
at Pechaburī. Dr. and Mrs. House were
designated for the post. The Doctor actually went
to Pechaburī; procured there, through the help of our
friend the Palat, a lot with a house on it; and thus
committed the mission to the project. But the day
before he was to start homeward to prepare for removal
thither, he was so seriously hurt by a fall from
his horse that he was confined to his bed for several
months. It was even feared that he was permanently
disabled for active life. A new adjustment of our
personnel was thus necessitated. Dr. Mattoon had
just returned from the United States with the Rev.
S. G. McFarland, the Rev. N. A. McDonald, and their
wives. Dr. Mattoon could not be spared from Bangkok,
nor was he enthusiastic over the new station.
Mr. McDonald had no desire for such experiments.
Both Mr. and Mrs. McFarland were anxious to move,
but were too new to the field to be sent out alone.
They were urgent that we should go with them. My
opportunity had come. So, early in June, 1861, we
broke up the first home of our married life, and, in
company with the McFarlands, moved on to our new
home and our new work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our friend, the Pra Palat, seemed pleased that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>had come, after all. His slight knowledge of English
had been learned as a private pupil from Mrs. McGilvary’s
own mother. He was glad, whenever he had
leisure, to continue his studies with Mrs. McGilvary.
Mr. McFarland preferred school work. He took the
son that I was to have taught, and left me untrammelled
to enter upon evangelistic work. The half-hour
after each evening meal we spent in united prayer for
guidance and success. Two servants of each family
were selected as special subjects of prayer; and these,
in due time, we had the pleasure of welcoming into
the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the incidents of our Pechaburī life I have room
for but a single one. As we were rising from the
dinner-table one Sunday shortly after our arrival, we
were surprised to see a man coming up the steps and
crossing the veranda in haste, as if on a special errand.
He led by the hand a little boy of ten or twelve years,
and said, “I want to commit this son of mine into
your care. I want you to teach him.” Struck by his
earnest manner, we drew from him these facts: He was
a farmer named Nāi Kawn, living some five miles out
in the country. He had just heard of our arrival, had
come immediately, and was very glad to find us.</p>

<p class='c009'>We asked whether he had ever met a missionary before.
No, he said, but his father—since dead—had
once met Dr. Bradley, and had received a book from
him. He had begged other books from neighbours who
had received them but did not value them. Neither
did he at first, till the great cholera scourge of 1849,
when people were dying all around him. He was
greatly alarmed, and learned from one of the books
that Pra Yēsū heard prayer in trouble, and could save
from sin. For a long time he prayed for light, until,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>about three years ago, he believed in Jesus, and was now
happy in heart. He had heard once of Dr. Bradley’s
coming to Pechaburī, but not until he was gone again.
He preached to his neighbours, who called him “Kon
Pra Yēsū” (Lord Jesus’ man). He had prayed for
Dr. Bradley and the missionaries; he had read the
story of Moses, the Epistle to the Romans, the Gospel
of John, a tract on Prayer, and “The Golden Balance”;
and he believed them. He could repeat portions
of Romans and John verbatim; and he had his son
repeat the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p class='c009'>My subject at the afternoon service was Nicodemus
and the New Birth. Nāi Kawn sat spellbound, frequently
nodding assent. At the close we asked him
to speak a few words; which he did with great clearness.
On being questioned as to the Trinity, he replied
that he was not sure whether he understood it. He
gathered, however, that Jehovah was the Father and
Ruler; that the Son came to save us by dying for us;
and that the Holy Spirit is the Comforter. The difference
between Jesus and Buddha is that the latter entered
into Nirvana, and that was the last of him;
while Jesus lives to save. He even insisted that he
had seen a vision of Jesus in heaven. His other experiences
were characterized by such marks of soberness
that we wondered whether his faith might not
have been strengthened by a dream or a vision.</p>

<p class='c009'>This incident, coming so soon after our arrival,
greatly cheered us in our work. His subsequent story
is too long to follow out in detail here. His piety and
his sincerity were undoubted. He lived and died a
Christian; yet he never fully identified himself with
the church. He insisted that he had been baptized by
the Holy Ghost, and that there was no need of further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>baptism. Not long after this Dr. Bradley and Mr.
Mattoon visited Pechaburī, examined the man, and
were equally surprised at his history.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>What changed our life-work from the Siamese to
the Lāo? There were two principal causes. The various
Lāo states which are now a part of Siam, were
then ruled by feudal princes, each virtually sovereign
within his own dominions, but all required to pay a
triennial visit to the Siamese capital, bringing the
customary gifts to their suzerain, the King of Siam,
and renewing their oath of allegiance to him. Their
realms served, moreover, as a “buffer” between Siam
and Burma. There were six of these feudal principalities.
Five of them occupied the basins of five chief
tributaries of the Mênam River; namely—in order
from west to east—Chiengmai, Lampūn, Lakawn, Prê,
and Nān. The sixth was Lūang Prabāng on the Mê
Kōng River. The rapids on all these streams had
served as an effectual barrier in keeping the northern
and the southern states quite separate. There was
no very frequent communication in trade. There was
no mail communication. Official despatches were
passed along from one governor to the next. Very
little was known in Bangkok about the Lāo provinces
of the north. A trip from Bangkok to Chiengmai
seemed then like going out of the world. Only one
Englishman, Sir Robert Schomburgk of the British
Consulate in Bangkok, had ever made it.</p>

<div id='i056'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i056.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>PAGODA OF WAT CHÊNG, BANGKOK</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Of these Lāo states, Chiengmai was the most important.
After it came Nān, then Lūang Prabāng
(since ceded to the French), Lakawn, Prê, and Lampūn.
The Lāo people were regarded in Siam as a very
warlike race; one chieftain in particular being famed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>as a great warrior. They were withal said to be suspicious
and unreliable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost the only visible result of my six months’ stay
within the city of Bangkok, after my marriage, was
the formation of a slight acquaintance with the Prince
of Chiengmai and his family. Just before my marriage
he had arrived in Bangkok with a great flotilla
of boats and a great retinue of attendants. The
grounds of Wat Chêng monastery, near to Dr. Bradley’s
compound, had always been their stopping-place.
The consequence was that, of all the missionaries, Dr.
Bradley had become best acquainted with them and
most deeply interested in them. He earnestly cultivated
their friendship, invited them to his printing-office
and to his house, and continually preached unto
them the Gospel. They were much interested in vaccination,
which he had introduced, and were delighted
to find that it protected them from smallpox.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day after our marriage, in response to a present
of some wedding cake, the Prince himself, with his two
daughters and a large train of attendants, called on us
in our new home. This was my first introduction to
Chao Kāwilōrot and his family, who were to play so
important a rôle in my future life. All that I saw
of him and of his people interested me greatly. During
the short time we remained in their neighbourhood,
I made frequent visits to the Lāo camp. The subject
of a mission in Chiengmai was talked of, with apparent
approval on the part of the Prince. My interest in
Pechaburī was increased by the knowledge that there
was a large colony of Lāo<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c020'><sup>[5]</sup></a> there. These were captives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of war from the region of Khōrāt, bearing no
very close resemblance to our later parishioners in
the north. At the time of our stay in Pechaburī, the
Lāo in that province were held as government slaves,
engaged all day on various public works—a circumstance
which greatly impeded our access to them, and
at the same time made it more difficult for them to embrace
Christianity. Neither they nor we dared apply
to the government for the requisite sanction, lest
thereby their case be made worse. Our best opportunity
for work among them was at night. My most
pleasant memories of Pechaburī cluster about scenes
in Lāo villages, when the whole population would assemble,
either around a camp-fire or under the bright
light of the moon, to listen till late in the night to the
word of God. The conversion of Nāi Ang, the first one
from that colony, anticipated that of Nān Inta, and the
larger ingathering in the North.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f5'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The application of this name is by no means uniform throughout
the peninsula. From Lūang Prabāng southward along the eastern
frontier, the tribes of that stock call themselves Lāo, and are so
called by their neighbours. But the central and western groups do
not acknowledge the name as theirs at all, but call themselves simply
Tai; or if a distinction must be made, they call themselves Kon Nûa
(Northerners), and the Siamese, Kon Tai (Southerners). The Siamese,
on the other hand, also call themselves Tai, which is really the
race-name, common to all branches of the stock; and they apply the
name Lāo alike to all their northern cousins except the Ngīo, or
Western Shans. Nothing is known of the origin of the name, but
the same root no doubt appears in such tribal and geographical
names as Lawā, Lawa, Lawō—the last being the name of the famous
abandoned capital now known as Lophburi.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But there was more than a casual connection between
the two. My labours among them increased
the desire, already awakened in me, to reach the home
of the race. Here was another link in the chain of
providences by which I was led to my life-work. The
time, however, was not yet ripe. The available force
of the mission was not yet large enough to justify
further expansion. Moreover, our knowledge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Lāo country was not such as to make possible any
comprehensive and intelligent plans for a mission
there. The first thing to do was evidently to make a
tour of exploration. The way to such a tour was
opened in the fall of 1863. The Presbytery of Siam
met in Bangkok early in November. I had so arranged
my affairs that, if the way should open, I could
go north directly, without returning to Pechaburī. I
knew that Mr. Wilson was free, and I thought he
would favour the trip. This he readily did, and the
mission gave its sanction. So I committed my wife
and our two-year-old daughter to the care of loving
grandparents, and, after a very hasty preparation,
we started on the 20th of November in search of far-away
Chiengmai.</p>

<p class='c009'>The six-oared touring-boat which I had fitted up in
my bachelor days was well adapted for our purpose
as far as the first fork of the Mênam. The Siamese
are experts with the oar, but are unused to the setting-pole,
which is well-nigh the only resource all through
the upper reaches of the river. It was sunset on a Friday
evening before we finally got off. But it was a
start; and it proved to be one of the straws on which
the success of the trip depended. The current against
us was very strong; so we slept within the city limits
that night. We spent all day Saturday traversing a
canal parallel with the river, where the current was
weaker. It was sunset before we entered again the
main stream, and stopped to spend Sunday at a monastery.
To our great surprise we found that the Prince
of Chiengmai—of whose coming we had had no intimation—had
camped there the night before, and had
passed on down to Bangkok that very morning. We
had missed him by taking the canal!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>We were in doubt whether we ought not to return
and get a letter from him. A favourable letter would
be invaluable; but he might refuse, or even forbid our
going. If we may judge from what we afterwards
knew of his suspicious nature, such probably would
have been the outcome. At any rate, it would delay
us; and we had already a passport from the Siamese
government which would ensure our trip. And, doubtless,
we did accomplish our design with more freedom
because of the Prince’s absence from his realm. It
was apparently a fortuitous thing that our men knew
of the more sluggish channel, and so missed the Lāo
flotilla. But it is quite possible that upon that choice
depended the establishment of the Lāo mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>All went well until we reached the first fork at Pāknam
Pō. There the water came rushing down like a
torrent, so swift that oars were of no avail. We tried
first one side of the stream and then the other, but
all in vain. Our boatmen exchanged their oars for
poles. But they were awkward and unaccustomed to
their use. The boat would inevitably drift down
stream. The poor boatmen laughed despairingly at
their own failure. At last a rope was suggested. The
men climbed the bank, and dragged the boat around
the point to where the current was less swift. But
when, as often happened, it became necessary to cross
to the other side of the river, the first push off the
bank would send us into water so deep that a fifteen-foot
pole could not reach bottom. Away would go
the boat some hundreds of yards down stream before
we could bring up on the opposite bank. We reached
Rahêng, however, in nineteen travelling days—which
was not by any means bad time.</p>

<p class='c009'>In our various journeyings hitherto we had controlled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>our own means of transportation. Henceforth
we were at the mercy of native officials, to whose
temperament such things as punctuality and speed
are altogether alien. From Rahêng the trip by elephant
to Chiengmai should be only twelve days. By
boat, the trip would be much longer, though the return
trip would be correspondingly shorter. We had
a letter from Bangkok to the officials along the route,
directing them to procure for us boats, elephants, or
men, as we might need. We were in a hurry, and,
besides, were young and impulsive. The officials at
Rahêng assured us that we should have prompt
despatch. No one, however, seemed to make any effort
to send us on. The governor was a great
Buddhist, and fond of company and argument. He
could match our Trinity by a Buddhist one: Putthō,
Thammō, Sangkhō—Buddha, the Scriptures, the
Brotherhood. Men’s own good deeds were their only
atonement. The one religion was as good as the other.
On these subjects he would talk by the hour; but when
urged to get our elephants, he always had an excuse.
At last, in despair, we decided to take our boatmen
and walk. When this news reached the governor,
whether from pity of us, or from fear that some trouble
might grow out of it, he sent word that if we would
wait till the next day, we should have the elephants
without fail.</p>

<p class='c009'>We got the elephants; but, as it was, from preference
I walked most of the way. Once I paid dear for my
walk by getting separated from my elephant in the
morning, losing my noonday lunch, and not regaining
my party till, tired and hungry, I reached camp at
night. Our guide had taken a circuitous route to
avoid a band of robbers on the main route which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>had followed! This was my first experience of elephant-riding.
We crossed rivers where the banks were
steep, and there was no regular landing. But whether
ascending or descending steep slopes, whether skirting
streams and waterfalls, one may trust the elephant’s
sagacity and surefootedness. The view we had from
one of the mountain ridges seemed incomparably fine.
The Mê Ping wound its way along the base beneath
us, while beyond, to right and to left, rose range beyond
range, with an occasional peak towering high
above the rest. But that was tame in comparison
with many mountain views encountered in subsequent
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were eight days in reaching Lakawn,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c020'><sup>[6]</sup></a> which we
marked as one of our future mission stations. On
being asked whether he would welcome a mission
there, the governor replied, “If the King of Siam and
the Prince of Chiengmai approve.” At Lakawn we
had no delay, stopping there only from Friday till
Monday morning. Thence to Lampūn we found sālās,
or rest-houses, at regular intervals. The watershed
between these towns was the highest we had crossed.
The road follows the valley of a stream to near the
summit, and then follows another stream down on the
other side. The gorge was in places so narrow that
the elephant-saddle scraped the mountain wall on one
side, while on the other a misstep would have precipitated
us far down to the brook-bed below.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f6'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A corruption of Nakawn (for Sanskrit <i>nagara</i>, capital city),
which is the first part of the official name of the place, Nakawn
Lampāng. The Post Office calls it Lampāng, to distinguish it from
another Nakawn (likewise Lakawn in common speech), in the Malay
Peninsula—the place known to Europeans as Ligor. The general
currency of this short name, and its regular use in all the missionary
literature, seem to justify its retention in this narrative.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>At Lampūn my companion was not well, so that
I alone called on the authorities. The governor had
called the princes together to learn our errand. They
seemed bewildered when told that we had no government
business, nor were we traders—were only teachers
of religion. When the proper officer was directed
to send us on quickly, he began to make excuses that
it would take two or three days. Turning sharply
upon him, the governor asked, “Prayā Sanām, how
many elephants have you?” “Four,” was the response.
“See that they get off to-morrow,” was the
short reply. He meekly withdrew. There was evidently
no trifling with that governor. One day more
brought us to Chiengmai—to the end of what seemed
then a very long journey. As we neared the city, Mr.
Wilson’s elephant took fright at the creaking noise
of a water-wheel, and ran away, crashing through
bamboo fences and trampling down gardens. Fortunately
no one was hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'>We reached the city on January 7th, 1864, on the
forty-ninth day of our journey. The nephew of the
Prince had been left in charge during the Prince’s
absence. He evidently was in doubt how to receive
us. He could not ignore our passport and letter from
Bangkok. On the other hand, why did we not have
a letter from the Prince? Our story of missing him
through choosing the canal instead of the main river
might or might not be true. If the deputy were too
hospitable, his Prince might blame him. So he cut
the knot, and went off to his fields. We saw no more
of him till he came in to see us safely off.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elder daughter of the Prince had accompanied
her father to Bangkok, but the younger daughter was
at home. She was a person of great influence, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>was by nature hospitable. Things could not have
been better planned for our purpose. The princess
remembered me and my wife from her call on us after
our wedding. She now called on us in person with
her retinue; after that everybody else was free to
call. It is not unlikely that that previous acquaintance
redeemed our trip from being a failure. Our
sālā was usually crowded with visitors. We had an
ideal opportunity of seeing the heart of the people.
They lacked a certain external refinement seen among
the Siamese; but they seemed sincere and more religious.
Buddhism had not become so much a matter
of form. Many of the older people then spent
a day and a night, or even two days, each month fasting
in the monasteries. There was hope that if such
people saw a better way, they would accept it. One
officer, who lived just behind our sālā, a great merit-maker,
was a constant visitor. Years afterward we
had the pleasure of welcoming him to the communion
of the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>From every point of view the tour was eminently
successful. Many thousands heard the Gospel for the
first time. In our main quest we were more than successful.
We were delighted with the country, the
cities, the people. Every place we came to we mentally
took possession of for our Lord and Master. In
Chiengmai we remained only ten days; but one day
would have sufficed to convince us. I, at least, left
it with the joyful hope of its becoming the field of my
life-work.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the first we had planned to return by the
river through the rapids. But the prince in charge
was very averse to our going by that route. We
knew that the route positively made no difference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>him personally. He had only to give the word, and
either elephants or boats would be forthcoming. Was
he afraid of our spying out the road into the country?
At last we were obliged to insist on the wording of
our letter, which specially mentioned boats. Then he
offered us one so small that he probably thought we
would refuse it. But we took it; and our captain
afterwards exchanged it for a larger one. We made
a swift passage through the famous rapids, and reached
Bangkok on January 30th, 1864.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first news that we heard on our arrival was
that Mrs. Mattoon was obliged to leave at once for the
United States, and that Mr. Wilson was to take his
furlough at the same time. This, of course, ended all
plans for any immediate removal to Chiengmai. We
hastened to Pechaburī, where the McFarlands had
been alone during our absence. Three years were to
pass before our faces were again turned northward.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>In the meantime, with two children added unto us,
we were become a family much more difficult to
move. We liked our home and our work. At
the age of thirty-nine, to strike out into a new work,
in a language at least partly new, was a matter not
to be lightly undertaken. Might it not be better that
Mr. Wilson should work up in the United States an
interest in the new mission, should himself select his
associates in it, and that I should give up my claim
to that place? It was certain that three families could
not be spared for Chiengmai. More than one day was
spent, under the shade of a great tree behind Wat Noi,
in thought on the subject, and in prayer for direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally—though it was a hard thing to do—I wrote
to Mr. Wilson, then in the United States, suggesting
the plan just stated. Feeling sure that it would
commend itself to him, I considered the door to
Chiengmai as probably closed to me. In the meantime
Mr. Wilson had married again; and on the eve
of his return wrote to me that he had failed to get
another family to come out with him, and was discouraged
about the Chiengmai mission. Probably the
time had not yet come, etc., etc. I was delighted to
get that letter. It decided me to go to Chiengmai,
the Lord willing, the following dry season, with only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>my own family, if need be. Dr. Mattoon and Dr.
House were absent on furlough. Mr. Wilson and I
would be the senior members of the mission. The
Board had already given its sanction. The mission
in Bangkok meanwhile had been reinforced by the
arrival of the Georges and the Cardens. On the return
of those then absent on furlough, one of these families
could join the McFarlands in Pechaburī, and yet there
would be four families in Bangkok. Such a combination
of favourable circumstances might not occur
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mr. Wilson arrived in Bangkok in the fall of
1866, a letter was waiting for him, asking him to
visit us in Pechaburī to talk over the question. On his
arrival we spent one Sunday in anxious consultation.
He was still eager to go to Chiengmai, but could not
go that year. His preference would be that we should
wait another year.—But that might be to lose the opportunity.
So next morning, leaving Mr. and Mrs.
Wilson to visit with my family, I hurried over to
Bangkok. There was no time to be lost. The Prince
of Chiengmai had been called down on special business,
and was soon to return. The whole plan might
depend on him—as, in fact, it did.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after dark on Tuesday night when I reached
Dr. Bradley’s, taking them all by surprise. I made
known my errand. Another long and anxious consultation
followed. I knew that Dr. Bradley’s great
missionary soul would not be staggered by any personal
considerations. It would be but the answer to
his own prayers to see a mission planted in Chiengmai.
In his heart he was glad that it was to be planted
by one of his own family. Earnest prayer was offered
that night at the family altar for guidance in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>negotiations of the following day, and for a blessing
on the mission that was to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Wednesday, after an early breakfast, Dr. Bradley
accompanied me to our mission. My colleagues,
McDonald, George, and Carden, were easily induced
to consent. Mr. McDonald said that he would not go
himself; but if I were willing to risk my family, he
would not oppose the scheme, and would vote to have
Mr. Wilson follow me the next year. Thus another
obstacle was removed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking Mr. McDonald and Mr. George with us, we
proceeded next to the United States Consulate, where
Mr. Hood readily agreed to give his official and personal
aid. The two greatest obstacles remained yet:
the Siamese government and—as it turned out in the
end—the Lāo Prince<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c020'><sup>[7]</sup></a> also. The Consul wrote immediately
to the King, through our former Pechaburī
friend, who had recently been made Foreign Minister,
a formal request for permission to open a station in
Chiengmai. It was Friday evening when the reply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>came that the decision did not rest with the King.
He could not force a mission upon the Lāo people.
But the Lāo Prince was then in Bangkok. If he gave
his consent, the Siamese government would give theirs.
He suggested that we have an audience with the
Prince, at which His Majesty would have an officer in
attendance to report directly to him.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f7'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lāo ruler was a feudal vassal of the King of Siam, governing
an important frontier province, and granted, within that province,
some of the powers which are usually thought of as belonging to
sovereignty—notably the power of life and death in the case of his
immediate subjects. His title, Pra Chao, like its English parallel,
Lord, he shared with the deity as well as with kings; though the
Kings of Siam claim the added designation, “<i>Yū Hūa</i>,” “at the
head,” or “Sovereign.” By the early missionaries, however, he was
regularly styled “King,” a term which to us misrepresents his real
status, and which leads to much confusion both of personality and
of function. Meantime both title and function have vanished with
the feudal order of which they were a part, leaving us free to seek
for our narrative a less misleading term. Such a term seems to be
the word Prince, thus defined in Murray’s Dictionary (<i>s. v.</i> II. 5):—“The
ruler of a principality or small state, actually, nominally, or
originally, a feudatory of a king or emperor.” The capital initial
should suffice generally to distinguish the Prince who is ruler from
princes who are such merely by accident of birth.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So on Saturday morning at ten o’clock we all appeared
at the landing where the Lāo boats were
moored, asking for an audience with the Prince. We
were invited to await him in the sālā at the river
landing. In a few moments His Highness came up in
his customary informal attire—a <i>phānung</i> about his
loins, no jacket, a scarf thrown loosely over his shoulders,
and a little cane in his hand. Having shaken
hands with us, he seated himself in his favourite attitude,
dangling his right leg over his left knee. He
asked our errand. At Mr. Hood’s request Dr. Bradley
explained our desire to establish a mission station
in Chiengmai, and our hope to secure his approval.
The Prince seemed relieved to find that our
errand involved nothing more serious than that. The
mission station was no new question suddenly sprung
upon him. We had more than once spoken with him
about it, and always apparently with his approbation.
To all our requests he now gave ready assent. Yes,
we might establish ourselves in Chiengmai. Land was
cheap; we need not even buy it. Timber was cheap.
There would be, of course, the cost of cutting and
hauling it; but not much more. We could build our
houses of brick or of wood, as we pleased. It was explained,
as he already knew, that our object was to
teach religion, to establish schools, and to care for the
sick. The King’s secretary took down the replies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the Prince to our questions. The Consul expressed
his gratitude, and committed my family to his gracious
care. We were to follow the Prince to Chiengmai as
soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the outward scene and circumstance of the
official birth of the Lāo mission. In itself it was
ludicrous enough: the audience chamber, a sālā-landing
under the shadow of a Buddhist monastery;
the Consul in his official uniform; the Prince <i>en
déshabillé</i>; our little group awaiting the answer on
which depended the royal signature of Somdet Phra
Paramendr Mahā Mongkut authorizing the establishment
of a Christian mission. The answer was, Yes.
I was myself amazed at the success of the week’s
work. On the part both of the Siamese government
and of the Lāo Prince, it was an act of grace hardly
to be expected, though quite in keeping with the liberality
of the truly great king who opened his country
to civilization and to Christianity. And the Lāo
Prince, with all his faults, had some noble and generous
traits of character.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later in the day I called alone to tell the Prince
that as soon as I could after the close of the rainy
season, I would come with my family. After the intense
excitement of the week, I spent a quiet Sabbath
in Dr. Bradley’s family, and on Monday morning could
say, as did Abraham’s servant, “Hinder me not, seeing
the Lord hath prospered me.” Taking the afternoon
tide, I hastened home to report the success of my trip,
to close my work in Pechaburī, and to make preparation
for a new station, which was soon to be a new
mission.</p>

<p>KĀWILŌROT, PRINCE OF CHIENGMAI<br />(ABOUT 1869)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The work in hand was easily turned over to Mr. McFarland,
an earnest and successful worker, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>become specially gifted in the Siamese language. The
Presbytery was to meet in Bangkok in November. The
last busy weeks passed rapidly away. At their end we
bade good-bye to our home and friends in Pechaburī.</p>

<p class='c009'>Friends in Bangkok gave us their hearty assistance.
The Ladies’ Sewing Society made a liberal contribution
to the new mission. Dr. James Campbell supplied
us with medicines and a book of instructions how
to use them. The German Consul gave us a Prussian
rifle for our personal protection. All our missionary
friends added their good wishes and their prayers.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had great difficulty in securing suitable boats
and crews for the journey. On January 3d, 1867, we
embarked, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Wilson to follow us
the next year. Mr. George accompanied us as far
as Rahêng. The trip is always a slow one, but we enjoyed
it. My rifle was useful in securing pelicans
and other large birds for food. Once I fired into a
large flock of pelicans on the river and killed three
with a single shot. Fish everywhere abounded. My
shotgun furnished pigeons and other small game. The
trip afforded fine opportunity for evangelistic work.
Nothing of the sort had ever been done there save the
little which Mr. Wilson and I had attempted on our
earlier trip.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rahêng was reached in four weeks. There we dismissed
the boats that had brought us from Bangkok,
and procured, instead, two large ones of the sort used
in up-country travel. We should have done better
with three of smaller size. We spent nearly a month
in toiling up the thirty-two rapids. At one of them
we were delayed from Friday noon till Tuesday afternoon.
At another, to avoid the furious current of
the main river, we attempted a small channel at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>side. As we slowly worked our way along, the water
in our channel became shallower and shallower, till we
had to resort to a system of extemporized locks. A
temporary dam was built behind the boat. The resulting
slight rise of water would enable us to drag
the boat a little further, till again it was stranded—when
the process would have to be repeated. After
two days of hard work at this, our boatmen gave up
in despair. A Chiengmai prince on his way to Bangkok
found us in this extremity, and gave us an order
to secure help at the nearest village. To send the
letter up and to bring the boatmen down would require
nearly a week. But there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>My rifle helped me somewhat to while away the time
of this idle waiting. We could hear tigers about us
every night. I used to skirt about among the mountain
ridges and brooks, half hoping to shoot one of
them. Since my rifle was not a repeater, it was no
doubt best that my ambition was not gratified. Once,
taking a Siamese lad with me, I strayed further and
returned later than usual. It was nearly dark when
we got back to the boats, and supper was waiting.
Before we had finished our meal, the boatmen caught
sight of the glowing eyes of a tiger that had followed
our trail to the further bank of the river, whence we
had crossed to our boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the boat captains professed to be able to call
up either deer or tiger, if one were within hearing. By
doubling a leaf together, and with thumb and finger
on either side holding the two edges tense between his
lips while he blew, he would produce a sound so nearly
resembling the cry of a young goat or deer, that a doe
within reach of the call, he claimed, would run to the
rescue of her young, or a tiger, hearing it, would run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to secure the prey. The two captains and I one day
went up on a ridge, and, selecting an open triangular
space, posted ourselves back to back, facing in three
directions, with our guns in readiness. The captain
had sounded his call only two or three times, when
suddenly a large deer rushed furiously up from the
direction toward which one of the captains was facing.
A fallen log was lying about twenty paces off on the
edge of our open space. The excited animal stopped
behind it, his lower parts concealed, but with back,
shoulder, neck, and head fully exposed. Our captain
fired away, but was so excited that he would have
missed an elephant. His bullet entered the log some
six inches below the top. In an instant the deer was
gone. We found not far off the spot where evidently
a young deer had been devoured by a tiger. We tried
the experiment a number of times later, but with no
success.</p>

<p class='c009'>After we had waited two days and nights for help
from the village above, on the third night the spirits
came to our rescue. Either with their ears or in
their imaginations, our crew heard strange noises in
the rocks and trees about them, which they interpreted
as a warning from the spirits to be gone. Next morning,
after consultation together, they made another
desperate effort, and got the boats off. It was still
several days before we met the men that came down
in response to the prince’s order. But some of the
worst rapids were yet before us. We could hardly
have got through without their aid.</p>

<p class='c009'>The efforts of a single crew, it must be remembered,
are utterly inadequate to bring a boat up through
any of these rapids. Only by combining two or three
crews can the boats be brought up one by one. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of the men are on the bank, tugging at the tow-rope
while they clamber over rocks and struggle through
bushes. Some are on board, bending to their poles.
Others are up to their waists in the rushing water, by
main force fending off the boat from being dashed
against the rocks. On one occasion I myself had made
the passage in the first boat, which then was left
moored in quieter waters. The crew went back to
bring up the second boat, in which were my wife and
children. With anxious eyes I was watching the
struggle; when, suddenly, in the fiercest rush of the
current, the men lost control of her. Boat and
passengers were drifting with full force straight
against a wall of solid rock on the opposite bank. It
seemed as if nothing could save them. But one of the
fleetest boatmen, with rope in hand, swam to a rock
in midstream, and took a turn of the rope about it,
just in time to prevent what would have been a
tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>At night, about camp-fires on the river bank, we were
regaled by the boatmen with legends of the country
through which we were passing. One of these legends
concerned the lofty mountain which rises above the
rapid called Kêng Soi, where we were camped. The
story was that on its summit there had been in ancient
times a city of <i>sētīs</i> (millionaires), who paid a gold
<i>fûang</i> (two dollars) a bucket for all the water brought
up for their use. It was said that remains of their
city, and particularly an aged cocoanut tree, were still
to be seen on the summit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since it would take our boatmen at least two days
to surmount that rapid, I resolved to attempt the
ascent, and either verify or explode the story. Starting
at early dawn with my young Siamese, zigzagging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>back and forth on the slope all that long forenoon, I
struggled upward—often despairing of success, but
ashamed to turn back. At last we stood on the top,
but it was noon or later. We spent two or three hours
in search of the cocoanut tree or other evidence of
human settlement, but all in vain. I was satisfied
that we were the first of human kind that had ever set
foot on that lofty summit. We had brought lunch—but
no water! Most willingly would we have given a
silver <i>fûang</i> for a draught.</p>

<p class='c009'>The legend of the rapids themselves was one of the
most interesting. At the edge of the plain above the
rapids there is pointed out a wall of rock dropping
fully a hundred feet sheer to the water’s edge. The
story goes that in ancient times a youth made love to
the Prince’s daughter. The course of true love did
not run smooth; the father forbade the suit. The lovers
resolved to make their escape. The young man
mounted his steed with his bride behind him, and
together they fled. But soon the enraged father was
in hot pursuit. They reached the river-brink at the
top of the precipice, with the father in plain sight behind
them. But there the lover’s heart failed him.
He could not take that leap. The maiden then begged
to exchange places with her lover. She mounted in
front; tied her scarf over her eyes; put spurs to the
horse; and took the fatal leap. To this day the various
rapids are mostly named from various portions of
the equipage which are supposed to have drifted down
the stream and lodged upon the rocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lāo witchcraft was another favourite theme of our
Rahêng boatmen. They were very much afraid of the
magical powers of wizards; and evidently believed
that the wizards could readily despatch any who offended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>them. They could insert a mass of rawhide
into one’s stomach, which would produce death, and
which could not be consumed by fire when the body was
cremated. They could make themselves invisible and
invulnerable. No sword could penetrate their flesh,
and a bullet fired at them would drop harmless from
the mouth of the gun.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we have lingered too long among the rapids.
Some distance above the last one the mountains on
either side recede from the river, and enclose the great
plain of Chiengmai and Lampūn. Both passengers
and boatmen draw a long breath of relief when it
opens out. The glorious sun again shines all day.
The feathery plumes of the graceful bamboo clumps
are a delight to the eye, and give variety to the otherwise
tame scenery. But the distant mountains are
always in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The season was advancing. The further we went,
the shallower grew the stream. Long before we
reached Chiengmai, we had to use canoes to lighten
our boats; but presently a seasonable rise in the river
came to our aid. On Saturday evening, April 1st,
1867, we moored our boats beside a mighty banyan
tree, whose spreading arms shaded a space more than
a hundred feet wide. It stands opposite the large
island which forty years later the government turned
over to Dr. McKean of our mission for a leper asylum.
Stepping out a few paces from under its shade, one
could see across the fields the pagoda-spires of Chiengmai.
There, prayerfully and anxiously, we spent the
thirteenth and last Sunday of our long journey, not
knowing what the future might have in store for us.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>On Monday morning, April 3d, 1867, we reached
the city. We had looked forward to the arrival
as a welcome rest after the long confinement
of our journey in the boat. But it was only the
beginning of troubles. We were not coming to an
established station with houses and comforts prepared
by predecessors. The Prince was off on a military
expedition, not to be back for over a month.
Till he came, nothing could be done. We could not
secure a house to shelter us, for there was none to be
had. Just outside the eastern gate of the city, however,
a sālā for public use had recently been built by
an officer from Rahêng, to “make merit,” according to
Buddhist custom. He had still a quasi claim upon it,
and, with the consent of the Prince’s representative,
he offered it to us. It was well built, with tile roof and
teak floor, was enclosed on three sides, and opened
in front on a six-foot veranda. In that one room, some
twelve feet by twenty, all our belongings were stored.
It served for bedroom, parlour, dining-room, and study.
In it tables, chairs, bedstead, organ, boxes, and trunks
were all piled one upon another. A bamboo kitchen
and a bathroom were presently extemporized in the
yard. That was our home for more than a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of the arrival of white foreigners soon
spread far and wide. It was not known how long they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>would remain; and the eagerness of all classes to get
sight of them before they should be gone was absolutely
ludicrous, even when most annoying. “There
is a white woman and children! We <i>must</i> go and see
them.” Our visitors claimed all the immunities of
backwoodsmen who know no better. In etiquette and
manners they well deserved that name. Within a few
feet of the sālā was a rickety plank-walk leading over
marshy ground to the city. Everybody had to pass
that way, and everybody must stop. When the veranda
was filled, they would crowd up on the ground
in front as long as they could get sight of anybody
or anything. If to-day the crowd prevented a good
view, they would call to-morrow. The favourite time
of all was, of course, our meal-time, to see how and
what the foreigners ate. Almost never in the daytime
could we sit down to a quiet meal without lookers-on.
It was not uncommon for our visitors to pick up a
knife or a fork or even the bread, and ask what that
was. “They don’t sit on the floor to eat, nor use their
fingers, as we do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This, however, is only one side of the picture. In
one sense we were partly to blame for our discomfort.
We could soon have dispersed the crowd by
giving them to understand that their presence was not
wanted. But we ourselves were on trial. If we had
got the name of being ill-natured or ungracious, they
would have left us, probably never to return. No.
This was what we were there for. It gave us constant
opportunities from daylight till dark to proclaim
the Gospel message. The first and commonest
question, who we were and what was our errand,
brought us at once to the point. We were come with
messages of mercy and with offer of eternal life from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the great God and Saviour. We were come with a
revelation of our Heavenly Father to His wandering
and lost children. While the mass of our visitors
came from curiosity, some came to learn; and many
who came from curiosity went away pondering whether
these things were so. Friendships also were formed
which stood us in good stead afterwards when we
sorely needed friends. During our time of persecution
these persons would come in by stealth to speak
a word of comfort, when they dared not do so openly.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the annoyance of those days fell most heavily
on the nerves of my wife, it was a comfort to learn
afterwards that possibly the very first convert heard
the Gospel message first from her lips, while she was
addressing a crowd of visitors very soon after our arrival.
Reference will be made to him later, but it
may be said here that from the day when he first heard
the news, he never again worshipped an idol.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever was their object in coming to see us, we
soon gave every crowd, and nearly every visitor, to
understand what we had come for. We had come as
teachers—primarily as teachers of a way of salvation
for sinners. And we never addressed a crowd of
thoughtful men or women who did not readily confess
that they were sinners, and needed a saviour from sin.
But we were not merely teachers of religion, though
primarily such. We could often, if not usually, better
teach religion—or, at least, could better lead up to it—by
teaching geography or astronomy. A little globe
that I had brought along was often my text.</p>

<p class='c009'>I presume that most Christian people in America
have a very crude idea of the method of preaching the
Gospel often, or, perhaps, generally, used by missionaries,
particularly in new fields. If they think that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the bell is rung, that the people assemble in orderly
fashion, and take their seats, that a hymn is sung,
prayer offered, the Scripture read, a sermon delivered,
and the congregation dismissed with the doxology and
benediction,—they are very much mistaken. All that
comes in time. We have lived to see it come in this
land—thanks to God’s blessing upon work much more
desultory than that. Long after the time we are now
speaking of, one could talk of religion to the people by
the hour, or even by the day; one might sing hymns,
might solemnly utter prayer, in response to inquiry as
to how we worshipped—and they would listen respectfully
and with interest. But if public worship had
been announced, and these same people had been invited
to remain, every soul would have fled away for
fear of being caught in some trap and made Christians
without their consent, or for fear of being made to
suffer the consequences of being reputed Christians before
they were ready to take that step. Forty years
later than the time we are now speaking of, I have
seen people who were standing about the church door
and looking in, driven quite away by the mere invitation
to come in and be seated.</p>

<p class='c009'>In one sense our work during the first year was very
desultory. I had always to shape my instruction to
the individuals before me. It would often be in answer
to questions as to where was our country; in what
direction; how one would travel to get there; could
one go there on foot; and so on. Or the question
might be as to the manners and customs of our nation;
or it might be directly on religion itself. But
as all roads lead to Rome, so all subjects may be turned
to Christ, His cross, and His salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the friends found in those early days I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>mention two. One was Princess Būa Kam, the mother
of the late and last Lāo Prince, Chao Intanon. At
our first acquaintance, she formed for us a warm
friendship that lasted till her death. Nor could I ever
discover any other ground for her friendship than the
fact that we were religious teachers. She was herself
a devout Buddhist, and continued to the last her offerings
in the monasteries. I believe that the Gospel
plan of salvation struck a chord in her heart which
her own religion never did. From Buddha she got no
assurance of pardon. The assurance that pardon is
possible in itself seemed to give her hope, though by
what process a logical mind could hardly see, so long
as she held on to a system which, as she confessed,
did not and could not give pardon. She was always
pleased to hear the story of the incarnation, the birth,
life, and miracles of Christ. She was deeply touched
by the recital of His sufferings, persecutions, and death.
Illustrations of the substitutionary efficacy of His sufferings
she readily understood. She acknowledged her
god to be a man who, by the well-nigh endless road to
nirvāna, had ceased to suffer by ceasing to exist. The
only claim he had to warrant his pointing out the way
to others was the fact that he had passed over it himself.
There was one ground, however, on which she
felt that she might claim the comfort both of the
doctrines which she still held and of ours, too. A
favourite theory of hers—and of many others—was
that, after all, we worship the same God under different
names. She called hers Buddha, and we call
ours Jehovah-Jesus.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had by nature a woman’s tender heart. Benevolence
had doubtless been developed in her by her religion,
till it had become a second nature. The gifts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>she loved to make were also a means of laying up a
store of merit for the future. She was most liberal in
sending us tokens of remembrance. These were not
of much value. A quart of white rice, a few oranges,
cucumbers, or cocoanuts on a silver tray, were so customary
a sight that, if ever any length of time elapsed
without them, we wondered if the Princess were ill.
And, on the other hand, if for any cause my calls were
far apart, she would be sure to send to enquire if I
were ill. The “cup of cold water” which she thus so
often pressed to our lips, I am sure, was given for the
Master’s sake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another remarkable friendship formed during that
first year was that of a Buddhist monk, abbot of the
Ūmōng monastery. As in the other case, there was no
favour to ask, no axe to grind. He never made a request
for anything, unless it were for a book. But the
little novice who attended him almost always brought
a cocoanut or some other small present for us. Very
early in our acquaintance he came to see that the universe
could not be self-existent, as Buddhism teaches.
On his deeply religious nature the sense of sin weighed
heavily. He was well versed in the Buddhist scriptures,
and knew that there was no place for pardon in
all that system. He understood the plan of salvation
offered to men through the infinite merit of Jesus
Christ. At times he would argue that it was impossible.
But the thought that, after all, it might be
possible, afforded him a gleam of hope that he saw
nowhere else; and he was not willing to renounce it
altogether.</p>

<p>TEMPLE OF THE OLD TĀI STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE, CHIENGMAI</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During the dark months that followed the martyrdom
of our native Christians, when many who were
true friends deemed it unwise to let their sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>be known, the good abbot visited us regularly, as, indeed,
he continued to do as long as he lived. At times
I had strong hopes that he would leave the priesthood.
But he never could quite see his way to do that,
though he maintained that he never ceased to worship
Jesus. The only likeness, alas! that I have of his dear
old face is a photograph taken after death, as his body
lay ready for cremation. Unto whom, if not unto such
true friends of His as these, was it said, “I was a
hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye
gave Me drink; I was in prison, and ye visited Me.—Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least
of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me”?</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c010'>VII<br /> <br />PIONEER WORK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The military expedition in which the Prince was
engaged detained him in the field until some
time in May. It was one of many unsuccessful
attempts to capture a notorious Ngīo chieftain who,
turning outlaw and robber, had gathered about him a
band of desperadoes, with whom he sallied forth from
his mountain fastness, raiding innocent villages and
carrying off the plunder to his stronghold, before any
force could be gathered to withstand or to pursue him.
In this way he kept the whole country in constant
alarm during the earlier years of our stay in Chiengmai.
What made matters worse was the fact—as the
Lāo firmly believed—that he had a charmed life, that
he could render himself invisible, and that no weapon
could penetrate his flesh. Had not the stockade
within which he had taken shelter been completely surrounded
one night by a cordon of armed men, and at
dawn, when he was to have been captured, he was nowhere
to be found? Such was the man of whom we
shall hear more further on.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Lāo New Year it is customary for all persons
of princely rank, all officers and people of influence, to
present their compliments to the Prince in person, and
to take part in the ceremony of “Dam Hūa,” by way
of wishing him a Happy New Year. Because of the
Prince’s absence in the field, this ceremony could not
be observed at the regular time; but it was none the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>less brilliantly carried out a few days after his return.
The name, Dam Hūa, means “bathing the head” or
“head-bath,” and it is really a ceremonial bathing or
baptism of the Prince’s head with water poured upon
it, first by princes and officials in the order of their
rank, and so on down to his humblest subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first and more exclusive part of the ceremony
took place in the palace, where I also was privileged
to offer my New Year’s greetings with the rest. The
great reception hall was crowded with the Prince’s
family and with officials of all degrees. The air was
heavy with the fragrance of flowers which loaded every
table and stand. All were in readiness with their silver
vessels filled with water, awaiting His Highness’ appearance.
At length an officer with a long silver-handled
spear announced his coming. The whole company
received him with lowest prostration after the
old-time fashion. Seeing me standing, he sent for a
chair, saying that the ceremony was long, and I
would be tired. The Court Orator, or Scribe, then
read a long address of welcome to the Prince on his
return from his brilliant expedition, with high-sounding
compliments on its success. Then there was a long
invocation of all the powers above or beneath, real or
imaginary, not to molest, but instead to protect, guide,
and bless His Highness’ person, kingdom, and people,
with corresponding curses invoked on all his enemies
and theirs. Then came the ceremonial bath, administered
first by his own family, his relatives, and high
officials—he standing while vase after vase of water
was poured on his head, drenching him completely
and flooding all the floor. It is a ceremony not at all
unpleasant in a hot climate, however unendurable it
might be in colder regions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>This was the beginning. According to immemorial
custom, a booth was prepared on a sand-bar in the
river. To this, after the ceremony in the palace, the
Prince went in full state, riding on an elephant richly
caparisoned with trappings of solid gold, to receive a
like bath at the hands of his loyal subjects—beginning,
as before, with some high nobles, and then passing on
to the common people, who might all take part in this
closing scene of the strange ceremony.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was not in the concourse at the river, but watched
the procession from our sālā, the Prince having said to
me that he would call on his return. This he did,
making us a nice little visit, taking a cup of tea, and
listening to the playing of some selections on the organ.
He asked if I had selected a place for a permanent
station, and suggested one or two himself. But I was
in no hurry, preferring to wait for the judgment of
Mr. Wilson on his arrival. Meanwhile I was assured
that I might remain in the sālā, and might put up a
temporary house to receive the new family. When I
requested his consent to the employment of a teacher,
he asked whom I thought of employing. I mentioned
the name of one, and he said, “He is not good. I will
send you a better one,”—and he sent me his own
teacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a very auspicious beginning. I knew that
neither the Siamese nor the Lāo trusted the Prince
very thoroughly; yet every time that I saw him it
seemed to me that I might trust him. At any
rate, I did not then look forward to the scenes that
we were to pass through before three years were
gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the first curiosity wore off, many of those who
came to our sālā were patients seeking medical treatment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The title “Maw” (doctor) followed me from
Bangkok, where all missionaries, I believe, are still so
called. This name itself often excited hopes which,
of course, were doomed to disappointment. To the
ignorant all diseases seem equally curable, if only there
be the requisite skill or power. How often during
those first five years I regretted that I was not a
trained physician and surgeon! My only consolation
was that it was not my fault. When my thoughts
were first turned towards missions, I consulted the
officers of our Board on the wisdom of taking at least
a partial course in preparation for my work. But
medical missions had not then assumed the importance
they since have won. In fact, just then they were at a
discount. The Board naturally thought that medical
study would be, for me at least, a waste of time, and
argued besides that in most mission fields there were
English physicians. But it so happened that eleven
years of my missionary life have been spent in stations
from one hundred to five hundred miles distant
from a physician. So, if any physician who reads
this narrative is inclined to criticise me as a quack, I
beg such to remember that I was driven to it—I had
to do whatever I could in the case of illness in my
own family; and for pity I could not turn away those
who often had nothing but superstitious charms to
rely on. It was a comfort, moreover, to know that
in spite of inevitable disappointments, our practice
of medicine made friends, and possibly enabled us to
maintain the field, at a time when simply as Christian
teachers we could not have done so. Even Prince
Kāwilōrot himself conceded so much when, after forbidding
us to remain as missionaries, he said we might,
if we wished, remain to treat the sick.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>In such a malarial country, there is no estimating
the boon conferred by the introduction of quinine alone.
Malarial fevers often ran on season after season, creating
an anæmic condition such that the least exertion
would bring on the fever and chills again. The astonishment
of the people, therefore, is not surprising when
two or three small powders of the “white medicine,”
as they called it, taken with much misgiving, would
cut short the fever, while their own medicines, taken
by the potful for many months, had failed. The few
bottles of quinine which it had been thought sufficient
to bring with me, were soon exhausted. The next
order was for forty four-ounce bottles; and not till our
physicians at length began to order by the thousand
ounces could a regular supply be kept on hand. I
have often been in villages where every child, and
nearly every person, young or old, had chills and fever,
till the spleen was enlarged, and the whole condition
such that restoration was possible only after months of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was another malady very common then—the
goitre—which had never been cured by any remedy
known to the Lāo doctors. I soon learned, however,
that an ointment of potassium iodide was almost a specific
in the earlier stages of the disease. That soon gave
my medicine and my treatment a reputation that no
regular physician could have sustained; for the people
were sure that one who could cure the goitre must be
able to cure any disease. If I protested that I was
not a doctor, it seemed a triumphant answer to say,
“Why, you cured such a one of the goitre.” Often
when I declined to undertake the treatment of some
disease above my skill, the patient would go away saying,
“I believe you could, if you would.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>One other part of my medical work I must mention
here, since reference will be made to it later. The
ravages of smallpox had been fearful, amounting at
times to the destruction of a whole generation of
children. The year before our arrival had witnessed
such a scourge. Hardly a household escaped, and
many had no children left. I was specially interested
to prevent or to check these destructive epidemics, because
the Prince had seen the efficacy of vaccination
as practised by Dr. Bradley in Bangkok, and because
I felt sure that what he had seen had influenced him
to give his consent to our coming. One of the surest
ways then known of sending the virus a long distance
was in the form of the dry scab from a vaccine pustule.
When once the virus had “taken,” vaccination went
on from arm to arm. Dr. Bradley sent me the first
vaccine scab. It reached me during the first season;
and vaccination from it ran a notable course.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Karens and other hill-tribes are so fearful of
smallpox that when it comes near their villages, they
all flee to the mountains. Smallpox had broken out in
a Lāo village near a Karen settlement. The settlement
was at once deserted. Meanwhile the news of the efficacy
of vaccination had reached the Lāo village, and
they sent a messenger with an elephant to beg me to
come and vaccinate the entire community. Two young
monks came also from an adjoining village, where the
disease was already raging. These two I vaccinated
at once, and sent home, arranging to follow them later
when their pustules should be ripe. From them I vaccinated
about twenty of the villagers. During the following
week the Karens all returned, and in one day
I vaccinated one hundred and sixty-three persons. It
was a strange sight to see four generations all vaccinated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>at one time—great-grandfathers holding out
their withered arms along with babes a month old.</p>

<p class='c009'>Success such as this was naturally very flattering
to one’s pride; and “pride goeth before a fall.” I
had kept the Prince informed of the success of my attempt,
and naturally was anxious to introduce vaccination
into the palace. The patronage of the palace
would ensure its introduction into the whole kingdom.
Having a fine vaccine pustule on the arm of a healthy
white infant boy, I took him to the palace to show the
case to the Prince’s daughter, and to her husband, who
was the heir-apparent. They had a little son of about
the same age. The parents were pleased, and sent me
with the child to the Prince. As soon as he saw the
pustule, he pronounced it genuine, and was delighted.
His younger daughter had lost a child in the epidemic
of the year before, and the family was naturally very
anxious on the subject. He sent me immediately to
vaccinate his little grandson.</p>

<p class='c009'>I returned to the palace of the son-in-law, and very
carefully vaccinated the young prince on whom so
many hopes were centred. I watched the case daily,
and my best hopes seemed realized. The pustules developed
finely. All the characteristic symptoms appeared
and disappeared at the proper times. But
when the scab was about to fall off, the little prince
was taken with diarrhœa. I felt sure that a little
paregoric or some other simple remedy would speedily
set the child right, and I offered to treat the case. But
half a dozen doctors—most of them “spirit-doctors”—were
already in attendance. The poor child, I verily
believe, was dosed to death. So evident was it that
the unfortunate outcome could not have been the result
of vaccination, that both the parents again and again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>assured me that they entertained no such thought. But
all diseases—as was then universally believed among
the Lāo—are the result of incurring the displeasure
of the “spirits” of the family or of the clan. The
“spirits” might have taken umbrage at the invasion of
their prerogative by vaccination.</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt some such thought was whispered to the
Prince, and it is not unnatural that he should at least
have half believed it. In his grief at the loss of his
grandson, it is easy to see how that thought may have
fanned his jealousy at the growing influence of the
missionaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>No year ever passed more rapidly or more pleasantly
than that first year of the mission. We were too
busy to be either lonesome or homesick, although, to
complete our isolation, we had no mails of any sort
for many months. Our two children, the one of three
and the other of six years, were a great comfort to us.
When we left Bangkok it was understood that a Mr. C.
of the Borneo Company was to follow us in a month on
business of their teak trade. He had promised to bring
up our mail. So we felt sure of getting our first letters
in good time. Since he would travel much faster
than we, it was not impossible that he might overtake
us on the way. But April, May, and June passed, and
still no word of Mr. C. or of the mails he was bringing.
In July we received a note from him, with a few fragments
of our long looked-for mail. He had been attacked
by robbers below Rahêng, himself had received
a serious wound, and his boat had been looted of every
portable object, including our mail-bag. Fortunately
the robbers, finding nothing of value to them in the
mail, had dropped as they fled some mutilated letters
and papers, which the officers in pursuit picked up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and which Mr. C. forwarded to us. Otherwise we
should have had nothing. We could at least be devoutly
thankful that we had traversed the same river
in safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was long before we were sure that Mr. Wilson and
his family were coming at all that year. It was at
least possible that any one of a thousand causes might
delay them, or even prevent their coming altogether.
Their arrival on February 15th, 1868, was, of course, a
great event.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not long after this we were eagerly awaiting a
promised visit from our old associate and friend, Dr.
S. R. House. Both Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. McGilvary
were expecting shortly to be confined, and the good
doctor was making the tedious journey that he might
be on hand to help them with his professional skill in
the hour of their need. Our dismay can be imagined,
when, one day, there appeared, not the doctor, but his
native assistant, with a few pencilled lines from the
doctor, telling us that he was lying in the forest some
four or five days distant, dangerously, if not fatally,
gored by an elephant. We were not to come to him,
but were to stand by and attend to the needs of our
families. He begged us to pray for him, and to send
him some comforts and medicines.</p>

<p class='c009'>The accident happened on this wise: The doctor had
been walking awhile for exercise behind his riding
elephant, and then attempted to pass up beside the
creature to the front. The elephant, startled at his unexpected
appearance, struck him to the ground with a
blow of his trunk, gored him savagely in the abdomen,
and was about to trample him under foot, when the
driver, not a moment too soon, got the creature again
under control. With rare nerve the doctor cleansed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the frightful wound, and sewed it up by the help of
its reflection in a mirror, as he lay on his back on the
ground. He despatched the messenger to us; gave
careful instructions to his attendants as to what they
should do for him when the inevitable fever and delirium
should come on; and resigned himself calmly
to await whatever the outcome might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>The situation was, indeed, desperate. We could
not possibly hope to reach him before the question of
life or death for him would be settled; nor could he be
brought to us. The best we could do was to get an
order from the Prince for a boat, boatmen, and carriers,
and despatch these down the river, committing
with earnest prayer the poor sufferer to the all-loving
Father’s care. The doctor was carried on a bamboo
litter through the jungle to the Mê Ping River, and in
due time reached Chiengmai convalescent, to find that
the two expected young missionaries had arrived in
safety before him. After a month’s rest he was able
to return to Bangkok; but not until he had assisted
us in organizing the First Presbyterian Church of
Chiengmai.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <i>Presbyterian Record</i> for November, 1868, will
be found an interesting report from the doctor’s pen.
Naturally he was struck with the predominance of
demon-worship over Buddhism among the Lāo. We
quote the following:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Not only offerings, but actually prayers are made to
demons. I shall never forget the first prayer of the kind I
ever heard.... We had just entered a dark defile in the
mountains, beyond Mûang Tôn, and had come to a rude,
imageless shrine erected to the guardian demon of the pass.
The owner of my riding-elephant was seated on the neck
of the big beast before me. Putting the palms of his hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>together and raising them in the attitude of worship, he
prayed: ‘Let no evil happen to us. We are six men and
three elephants. Let us not be injured. Let nothing come
to frighten us,’ and so on. On my way down the river, at
the rapids and gloomy passes in the mountains the boatmen
would land, tapers would be lighted, and libations would be
poured, and offerings of flowers, food, and betel would be
made to the powers of darkness.”</p>

<p class='c027'>The doctor speaks also of “the favour with which the missionaries
were received, the confidence they had won from all
classes, the influence of their medicines, and the grand
field open for a physician.” He frankly says, “I must confess
that though at one time I did have some misgivings
whether, all things considered, the movement was not a little
premature, I now, being better able to judge, greatly honour the
Christian courage and enterprise which undertook the work;
or rather bless God who inspired Mr. McGilvary’s heart, and
made his old Princeton friend, Mr. Wilson, consent to join
him in thus striking out boldly into an untried field. It
will prove, I trust, a field ready to the harvest.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c010'>VIII<br /> <br />FIRST-FRUITS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>During the first three months after Mr. Wilson’s
arrival we were so occupied with mission
work and with family cares that we had
not made choice of the lot which the Prince had promised
to give us. On the very day that Dr. House left
us, however, the Prince came in person, selected, and
made over to us our present beautiful mission compound
on the east bank of the Mê Ping. He would not
allow us to offer any compensation; but, learning afterwards
that the native owners had received no remuneration,
we secretly paid them. Mr. Wilson began at once
to erect temporary bamboo buildings, and soon moved
to the new compound. Since it was difficult for me
to spare time for further work of building for myself,
and since the old location was an ideal one for meeting
the people, I moved with my family from the sālā
into the bamboo house the Wilsons had occupied, and
we made it our home for the next two years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wilson was greatly interrupted in his work by
sickness in his family. Little Frank had fallen ill
on the journey from Bangkok, and continued to suffer
during all these months. His death on November 17th,
1868, was a heavy stroke to us all. In vain we combined
our slight medical skill, and searched our books
of domestic medicine for his relief. It was pitiful
enough to see the natives die, with the sad feeling in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>our hearts that a physician might have saved their
lives. But the death of one of our own number, so
soon after the trying experiences early in the year,
emphasized, as nothing else could have done, our appeals
for a physician. Yet it was not until 1872 that
we welcomed the first physician appointed to our
mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>During this time raids were continually being made
into the Lāo country by the renegade Ngīo chieftain
already spoken of. Five hundred men from Prê, and
one thousand from Lakawn were drafted for the defence
of the city, and were stationed near our compound.
Thus hundreds of soldiers and workmen furnished us
an ever-changing audience. All we had to do, day or
night, was to touch the organ, and people would crowd
in to hear. The dry season of 1868-69 was, therefore,
an exceptionally good one for our work. We had constant
visitors from other provinces, who would converse
with us by the hour, and, on returning to their
homes, would carry the news of our presence and of
our work.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the fall of 1868 occurred two events which, widely
different as they might seem to be, were in reality
closely connected, and of much importance in their
bearing on the mission. One was a total eclipse of the
sun on August 17th, and the other was the conversion
of Nān Inta, our first baptized convert. I well remember
his tall figure and thoughtful face when he
first appeared at our sālā, shortly after our arrival
in Chiengmai. He had a cough, and had come for
medicine. He had heard, too, that we taught a new
religion, and wished to enquire about that. Some
soothing expectorant sufficiently relieved his cough to
encourage him to make another call. On each visit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>religion was the all-absorbing topic. He had studied
Buddhism, and he diligently practised its precepts.
As an abbot he had led others to make offerings for
the monastery worship, and he had two sons of his
own in the monastic order. But Buddhism had never
satisfied his deep spiritual nature. What of the thousands
of failures and transgressions from the results
of which there was no escape? The doctrine of a free
and full pardon through the merits of another, was
both new and attractive to him, but it controverted
the fundamental principle of his religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had some arguments, also, on the science of
geography, on the shape of the earth, on the nature
of eclipses, and the like. What he heard was as foreign
to all his preconceived ideas as was the doctrine
of salvation from sin by the death of Christ. Just before
the great eclipse was to occur I told him of it,
naming the day and the hour when it was to occur.
I pointed out that the eclipse could not be caused by
a monster which attacked the sun, as he had been
taught. If that were the cause, no one could foretell
the day when the monster would be moved to make
the attack. He at once caught that idea. If the
eclipse came off as I said, he would have to admit
that his teaching was wrong on a point perfectly
capable of being tested by the senses. There would
then be a strong presumption that we were right in
religion as well as in eclipses. He waited with intense
interest for the day to come. The sky was clear, and
everything was favourable. He watched, with a
smoked glass that we had furnished, the reflection
of the sun in a bucket of water. He followed the
coming of the eclipse, its progress, and its passing off,
as anxiously as the wise men of old followed the star of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Bethlehem—and, like them, he, too, was led to the
Saviour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early the next morning he came in to see me. His
first words were, “Mên tê” (It’s really true). “The
teacher’s books teach truth. Ours are wrong.” This
confident assurance had evidently been reached after
a sleepless night. A complete revolution had taken
place in his mind; but it was one that cost him a
severe struggle. His only hope had rested on the
teachings of Buddha, and it was no light thing to see
the foundation of his hope undermined. The eclipse
had started an ever-widening rift. He began, as never
before, to examine the credentials of Christianity. He
soon learned to read Siamese in order to gain access
to our Scriptures. We read the Gospel of John together.
He studied the Shorter Catechism. He had
a logical mind, and it was never idle. Whenever we
met, if only for a few moments, he always had some
question to ask me, or some new doubt to solve. When
tempted to doubt, he fell back on the eclipse, saying,
“I know my books were wrong there. If the Gospel
system seems too good to be true in that it offers to
pardon and cleanse and adopt guilty sinners, and give
them a title to a heavenly inheritance, it is simply
because it is divine, and not human.” While the truth
dawned gradually on his mind, the full vision seemed
to be sudden. His own account was that afterwards,
when walking in the fields and pondering the subject,
it all became very plain to him. His doubts all vanished.
Henceforth for him to live was Christ; and
he counted all things but loss for the excellency of
the knowledge of Him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversion of Nān Inta was an epoch in the history
of the mission. The ordinary concourse of visitors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>might be for medicine, or it might be from mere
curiosity. But when one of the most zealous
Buddhists, well known by members of the royal family,
openly embraced Christianity, the matter began
to assume a different aspect. What was more remarkable
still was that he urged his two sons to abandon
the monastic order. The Prince’s younger daughter,
herself a strong Buddhist, told me that this was to her
convincing evidence of his sincerity. Whether Christianity
were true or false, he certainly believed it true.
It was the height of ambition for every Lāo father to
have a son in the order. If he had none of his own,
he often would adopt one and make him a monk. But
here was one of the most devout of them urging his
own sons to come out and be Christians! We regarded
it as a favourable circumstance that the patron
and protector of this our first convert was high in
princely rank. Nān Inta’s defection from Buddhism
produced a profound impression among all classes.
Emboldened by his example, secret believers became
more open. Not the number alone, but the character of
the enquirers attracted attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second convert was Noi Sunya, a native doctor
from a village eight miles to the east. He has the
enviable distinction of never having postponed the
Gospel offer. He was the chief herdsman in charge
of the Prince’s cattle. Coming to the city on an
errand, he called at our sālā to see what was the attraction
there. As in the case of so many others, it
was the good news of pardon for a sinsick soul that
arrested his attention. On his return in the afternoon
he called again to make fuller enquiry concerning
“the old, old story of Jesus and His love.” He
promised to return on Sunday. Promises of that sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>so often fail, that we were surprised and delighted to
see him early on Sunday morning. We had an earnest
talk together before the time came for public worship.
He remained through the afternoon, and spent the
night with us. In answer to a final exhortation before
he left us in the morning, he said, “You need not
fear my going back. I feel sure I am right.” He was
willing to sell all—even life itself, as it proved—for
the pearl of great price. He went home, called his
family together, and began family worship that very
night. Only four brief months after this his labours
were ended by the executioner’s stroke, and he wore
the martyr’s crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third, Sên Yā Wichai, has already been mentioned
as receiving his first instruction in Christianity
from the “mother-teacher,” as Mrs. McGilvary was
called, during the very first month of the mission. He
then received the great truth of the existence of God
and of man’s accountability to Him. He was an officer
living six days’ journey to the north, and was under
the jurisdiction of the Prince of Lampūn. On his
visit a year later, he received further instruction, was
baptized, and returned to tell his neighbours what he
had found. They only laughed at him for his oddity
in refusing to join in the Buddhist worship, and in
offerings to the spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth was Nān Chai, a neighbour and friend of
Noi Sunya, and destined to suffer martyrdom along
with him. He, too, was an ex-abbot, and, therefore,
exempt from government work. He was a good
scholar, and was employed by Mr. Wilson as a teacher.
When he became a Christian, he was strongly tempted
to hold on still to his position in the monastery, explaining
that he would not himself engage in the worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>but would only sweep the buildings and keep
the grounds in order for others. But when his duty
was pointed out to him, he readily gave up his position,
and was enrolled for regular government service.
Here were four noble and notable men at once deserting
the Buddhist faith! No wonder it became an
anxious question whereunto this was to grow.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c010'>IX<br /> <br />MARTYRDOM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>In the course of these events our second year of
work in Chiengmai had come to its end. We
were now beyond the middle of the year 1869. As
some indefinable sense of oppression in the air gives
warning of the approaching storm, so there were ominous
hints, and even some dark forebodings. Our
Christian people—who understood far better than we
did both the character of their rulers and the significance
of furtive looks and innuendoes—were
anxious. But they stood firm, and their faith strengthened
ours.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the light of subsequent events we now know
that the most dangerous element in the gathering
storm was the angry surprise of the Prince himself at
the discovery that the old order seemed actually passing
away under his very eyes; that his will was no
longer supreme in men’s minds, nor always consulted
in their actions—this and the deep treachery and ruthless
cruelty of his nature which it brought into play.
But there were other sinister influences at work also,
and among them we must not overlook that of a certain
Portuguese adventurer, Fonseca by name. He was a
thoroughly unprincipled man, who, having played his
game in Bangkok and lost, had worked himself into
the favour of the Prince during his recent visit to the
capital, and had accompanied him on his return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to Chiengmai. The Prince was persuaded that this
man could be of great service to him in the two matters
which were then causing him most disquietude;
namely, the defence of certain lawsuits involving large
sums of money, brought against him in the British
Consular Court by Burmese timber merchants; and
the getting rid of the missionaries. These last were
more in Fonseca’s way than they were in the Prince’s.
He could accomplish his ends more readily if they
were not there.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most plausible excuse that could be offered
for desiring to be rid of the missionaries was the failure
of the rice crop that year. In the early part of the
season there was no rain at all. When at last the
fields had been planted, one of the worst floods ever
known in that region destroyed all the lowland rice.
Then, finally, the rains ceased prematurely, and the
upland crop was cut off by drought. The presence
of the missionaries in the country had offended the
spirits, and they had withheld the rain. Such was the
pretext urged in a petition sent to Bangkok to have
the missionaries removed. The specific address of the
petition to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the
United States Consul leads one to suspect that the
matter was directed by some one who understood the
order of official business much better than did the Lāo
Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Minister forwarded the document to Mr. McDonald,
the acting Vice-Consul at the time. Mr. McDonald
replied to the Minister that there must be
some mistake about it. It appeared that the scarcity
of rice complained of had begun the year before the
arrival of the missionaries; it was not confined to
Chiengmai, but extended over all the northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>provinces. He added roguishly, however, that he
would strictly enjoin the American missionaries to be
very careful in future not to cause any famine. Of
all this secret plotting we were entirely ignorant at the
time, and learned of it only long afterwards. While
these plots were developing, I was frequently visiting
the Prince, and all our relations with him were apparently
satisfactory. But we knew that he was under
the influence of a wily and unprincipled adversary.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other matter in which Fonseca was supposed to
be able to help his patron out of difficulties even more
pressing, was the Burmese lawsuits pending before the
British Consul. But the British government was the
last party to permit officious meddling with its public
business from such a quarter. It is presumed that
there was evidence of his interference with official correspondence.
This much is certain—a peremptory demand
was made on the Siamese government for his recall.
The official order sent up was too emphatic to
be neglected. The man was sent out of the country
in quite different style from that in which he entered
it. This man is known to have been present at the
consultation relative to the mission. If the jealousy
and suspicion on the part of the Prince did not originate
with him, there is no doubt that he at least
worked on the Prince’s suspicious nature, increasing
his jealousy of the growing popularity of the mission,
and leading him to think that it would be wise to stop
it in its incipiency.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet even when the blow was about to fall, we could
not believe that the Prince was so treacherous as to
plan to drive us out of the country, at the same time
that he continued to treat us so kindly, and would
even come to dine with us. We could not believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the younger Princess, who had a predominating influence
over her father, could encourage one of the
Christians to put himself under her protection, only
that he might the more surely be sent to his death a
day or two later. We could not believe that an excursion
down the river had been planned by the
Prince, only that he might be out of reach when the
executions should take place. We were still incredulous,
even after we received reliable information from
the agent of the Borneo Company that he had heard
the Prince and a certain high officer consulting together
to stop our work. The plan which he reported was
to expel the converts from the country, giving their
wives and children the option to follow them or to
remain. After all, that would not have been so great
a disaster. These men had no great possessions to
lose. Their banishment would only plant the Gospel
in other provinces or other lands.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, in September, 1869, just before the fatal
stroke, the Prince started on what purported to be a
three weeks’ fishing trip, we thought that his absence
would give us a respite from our present fears, and
would afford him leisure for better thoughts. As his
boats pushed off, we waved him a parting good-bye from
the shore. His first business was at Lampūn, to secure
the co-operation of the governor of that province
in ridding the country of the new religion. Inasmuch
as Sên Yā Wichai, the third convert mentioned above,
was a Lampūn officer, it was thought prudent in his
case to secure the action of his own immediate superior.
He was at once sent for, and was condemned to
death, but was saved by his young master, the governor’s
son, on the plea that he was a backwoodsman,
and knew no better.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Of the deep designs against us and our work we
were thus either ignorant or incredulous till, on the
evening of September 13th, just before dark, our
night watchman came to us with the common excuse
for leaving us, that some relative was dead or dying,
and insisting that he must go immediately. In vain
we urged that he must not leave us thus in the lurch.
As a final argument, we threatened to dock him of a
month’s wages. But wages were nothing to him then.
“All that a man hath will he give for his life.” While
we talked to him, he had reached the gate and was
gone. So, also, fled the cook and the coolie, leaving
only one blind Ngīo who had taken refuge with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wilson then lived across the river on the new
premises, and it was not until the next day that we
learned that all his people, too, had fled in like manner
and at the same hour. We went to Prayā Tēpasing,
the Prince’s executive officer, to enquire the cause. He
feigned surprise, and professed entire ignorance of
any designs against the Christians. He said, however,
that the Prince had given an order that the inhabitants
of certain villages should bring in each a
hewn slab of timber to repair the stockade. Possibly
the scare might have somehow arisen from that. We
were aware of the order, and had told the Christians
that if pressed for time to procure the timber, they
might each take a slab of ours. We now told the
Prayā that we would ourselves be responsible for the
timbers required of them. To assure us with regard
to our servants, the Prayā sent for our cook, gave him
a letter assuring his safety, and threatened, besides,
to have him flogged if he deserted us. The cook remained
with us all through these troubles, until we
could find another to take his place. For some reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Mr. Wilson did not avail himself of this offer. He and
Mrs. Wilson got on as they could without servants for
several months.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now know that the order for the execution of
the Christians had been given long before by that
same Prayā Tēpasing—in such fear of the Prince was
the highest officer in the realm! Not only had our
servants vanished—there was a sudden cessation of our
visitors as well. Few even dared to come for medicine
for fear of being suspected of becoming Christians.
There were, however, a few notable exceptions,
the abbot of the Ūmōng monastery being the most conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the following week Mr. Wilson waded out
across the flooded country to the home of Nān Chai,
his teacher. But his family did not dare to give any
information concerning him. To tell what they knew
would cost their lives also—so they had been told. He
then went on another mile to Noi Sunya’s home, with
the same result. The wives of both these men pretended
to believe that their husbands had gone to the
city to visit us. Mr. Wilson noticed that one of the
women had tears in her eyes as she spoke. Puzzled
rather than satisfied by the result of the visit, Mr.
Wilson returned with the hope that, after all, the
men were still alive, and that we yet should see them
in the land of the living.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was two weeks before our suspense was broken by
the certainty of their death. On Sunday morning,
September 26th, a Ngīo friend and neighbour of the
martyrs called at my house. After looking all about
him, he asked where the Christians were. I told him
there seemed to be a mystery about them that we could
not unravel, but we hoped they were secreting themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in safety somewhere. Seeing that I was really
ignorant of their fate, he came close up to me, and
looking around again to assure himself that no one
was near, he asked, “If I tell you, will you promise
never to betray me?” Having demanded and received
an emphatic promise equivalent to an oath, he
drew his hand significantly across his neck, and whispered,
“That is the way.” His gesture was too well
understood in that reign to leave any doubt as to what
was meant. The man had really come on a sad and
dangerous errand of kindness. As soon as it was accomplished,
he hurried away, evidently fearing that
the birds of the air might hear it, or that some breeze
might waft it to the palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday morning Mr. Wilson and I went again
to the Prayā. He could now no longer lie for his
master as to the fact of the execution of the men,
but he offered the flimsy excuse that it was because
they had not brought in their slabs on time. We were
then obliged to charge him with patent falsehood. He
knew that they were executed for no crime whatever,
but only for being Christians. Poor man! He seemed
somewhat ashamed; but what could he do? He was
not at heart a bad man, as his letter of protection for
the cook showed. The lives of two peasants were no
great matter in those days. He had been so trained
to execute every behest of his master, that it scarcely
occurred to him that he ought to hesitate at this.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was some relief to know the worst, and to
know that it was known that we knew it. Before this
we had been obliged to feign hopes that we hardly believed
ourselves. Now we could speak openly. The
Prince had not yet returned from his fishing trip; so
we went to his elder daughter and her husband, afterward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Prince Intanon. In their position they could not
say much; but they did say that what the Prince had
done was not right, and that they did not approve of
the act.</p>

<p class='c009'>One outcome of the situation was a flood of the
wildest rumours—some of them, no doubt, started on
purpose to frighten us away. One of these touched us
in a most tender point. One of our most faithful
servants, who had been with us from the very first, was
desirous of visiting Bangkok. So we arranged to have
him go down in charge of a boat that was to bring
up our supplies for the year. By him we sent a large
package of letters written before we had reason to
suspect so serious an outcome of the troubles that were
brewing. While we could not conceal some gloomy
forebodings, our reports were, on the whole, full of
hope for the speedy progress of the Gospel. The boat
left for Bangkok a few days after the Prince started
on his fishing trip. Presently it was reported that the
boat had been intercepted, and that this man, with his
wife, his son, and his son’s family, even down to a little
grandchild of two years old, had been killed, and
the boat broken to pieces and burned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although such atrocity seemed beyond belief, yet a
number of circumstances combined to give the report
credibility. Why, for instance, was the long, unusual
trip down the river taken just before our boat was to
start? What did it mean that, after the murder of
the Christians was known, no sum of money could induce
a Lāo man to take a letter to Bangkok? If the
story of the fate of our messenger were true, the act
was the act of a madman—and there is no telling
what a madman may not do. He was in a position
to keep us from escaping; and if he had really gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>so far as that, he evidently did not intend that we
should be heard from alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time we virtually resigned ourselves to what
seemed inevitable fate. When we could get no letters
sent, we actually began writing the history of those
days on the margins of books in our library, so that,
if we were never heard from again, some of the precedent
circumstances of our end might thus, perhaps,
come to light. It was a great relief, therefore, when an
influential Burmese, knowing our situation, offered
to carry a letter through to our friends in Bangkok.</p>

<p class='c009'>On September 29th, when the letters carried by the
Burmese were written, we were still under the impression
that our boatman had been murdered, and
that neither he nor the letters and reports carried by
him had been heard from. It was the knowledge that
these rumours were false, and that he had passed
Rahêng in safety, that first relieved our minds. So,
too, his arrival in Bangkok gave our friends there the
first assurance of our safety. With this explanation
the letters themselves will give the best idea of our
situation in those dark days. The following is from
a letter of Dr. S. R. House to our Mission Board in
New York, printed in the <i>Presbyterian Record</i> of
February, 1870. It is dated November 11th, 1869.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Since our last mail was despatched, tidings have been
received from the mission families in North Laos which
have greatly distressed and alarmed us, causing no little
anxiety for their personal safety. This outburst of persecution
from which they are now suffering must have been quite
unlooked for, for their letters down to September 10th were
full of encouragement. Never had the king and the princes<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c020'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>seemed more friendly; never had their prospects seemed
brighter. Seven interesting converts had been baptized
since the year began, and they had just been enjoying a
wonderfully favourable opportunity to make the gospel message
known to the people from every part of the kingdom.... What
has caused this sudden change in the demeanour
of the king of Chiengmai toward our missionaries there,
does not appear....</p>

<div class='footnote c022' id='f8'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That is the Prince of Chiengmai and the nobility. These terms
are so used generally throughout this correspondence.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c024'>“Thus far they seem to have had no apprehension for
themselves personally; but the next letter, of two days’ later
date, indicates that something had occurred or had come to
their knowledge which led them to believe that their own
lives were in jeopardy. On September 29th Mr. McGilvary
writes hurriedly to his father-in-law, Rev. D. B. Bradley,
M.D., of the A. M. A. mission as follows:—</p>

<p class='c027'>“‘Dear Father and Mother:—We write to tell you that we
may be in great danger. If you never hear from us more,
know that we are in heaven. Send some one up here to look
after our Christians, and do not, we beg you, grieve over the
loss of our lives. Two of our church members died at the
martyr’s stake on the 14th of September. Warrants are
out for the others. What is before us we do not know. We
are all peaceful, and very happy. We have written letters
giving the full facts, but dare not send them for fear of their
interception.</p>

<p class='c027'>“‘Lung Puk left here on the 12th direct for Bangkok.
Should he never reach you, you may fear the worst for
us.... He had a large mail with our reports, etc. Should
worst come to worst, we have counted the cost beforehand,
and our death will not be in vain. Love to all the dear ones.
Good-bye, dear father, mother, brothers, sisters, and friends—perhaps
till we meet in heaven!’”</p>

<p class='c025'>Dr. House then continues:</p>

<p class='c024'>“That these letters—the last one especially—awakened our
deepest solicitude, I need not assure you. The brethren
from the Pechaburī station reached Bangkok, to attend the
annual session of Presbytery, the very day the startling
tidings came; and anxious were our deliberations, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>earnest our prayers in behalf of those brethren beloved and
their helpless families. A month had then elapsed since the
date of the letters. Were they still in the land of the living?</p>

<p class='c027'>“It was deemed advisable that some of our number should
proceed as far up the river as possible—to Rahêng at least—to
learn the existing state of things and extend all possible
assistance. After consultation this service devolved on Bros.
McDonald and George.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Owing to the peculiar allegiance which holds the Lāo
tribes tributary to the Siamese, it was thought best not to
press any doubtful treaty rights and claims through the
United States Consul—that is, the protection they would
be entitled to claim anywhere on the soil of Siam proper—but
to throw ourselves on the friendliness and goodwill
of the Siamese Government as old residents here, most of
us, who are greatly troubled lest harm should befall our
friends who are living in one of their tributary states.
What could they do to help us?</p>

<p class='c027'>“The deputation, consisting of Dr. Bradley, Mr. McDonald,
Mr. George, and myself, were most kindly received
by the new Regent of the kingdom, the late Prime Minister—were
received in every respect as friends, and the best endeavours
of the Siamese Government were promised. A
government official would be despatched at once bearing a
letter to the king of Chiengmai, enjoining on him to give
protection to the missionaries. But the Regent added, ‘It
is difficult to deal with a man so moody and arbitrary as this
Chief of Chiengmai. He is like King Theodore of Abyssinia.’—This
too significant comparison had already suggested
itself in anything but an agreeable way to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c027'>“The Siamese move slowly at the best, and the brethren
who have consented to go on this errand so full of perplexity
and possible peril started several days before the
royal messenger’s preparations were completed. We are
waiting with the greatest solicitude further tidings. I must
say from what I know of the character of the man in whose
hands and at whose mercy they are, that I have great fears.
Others here, however, are confident that no harm can come to
them personally.”</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The following, from a note of mine to the Board,
will throw further light on our letter to our friends
and on our situation. It was dated October 31st, while
we were anxiously waiting for the reply to our letters.</p>

<p class='c024'>... “But the particular fact that filled us with deepest
anxiety when we sent that note to Bangkok, was a rumour
that the king had, in person, stopped a boat in charge of our
old servant whom we had sent down to Bangkok after money
and supplies, and had put him, his wife, and all the boatmen
to death. That rumour was currently believed here, and we
had so many questions asked us about them by persons in
high and in low station, that we were constrained almost to
believe it. And if that had been done, we knew not what
would come next. Of course we had serious apprehensions
regarding our own safety; yet our duty was clear. However
dangerous our position, we felt that flight would be more
dangerous.... Our strength was to sit still....</p>

<p class='c027'>“After waiting a month in suspense about our servants,
we have just learned, on pretty good authority, that they were
not murdered. They have been reported as having passed
Rahêng. In a few days we shall know the truth. If they
are safe, our greatest fears were groundless. We wait to see
the Lord’s purpose in reference to this people. We yet believe
they are purposes of mercy. The excitement has somewhat
died down, and we have daily many visitors. But there
is great fear of the authorities. No one feels safe; no one
knows what will come next.”</p>

<p class='c025'>I quote from a letter of Mr. Wilson to the Board the
following account of the suffering and death of the
martyrs, written January 3d, 1870, after all the various
rumours had been sifted, and the facts were clearly
known. Meantime the Commission referred to in the
letter of Dr. House had come, and this letter was
brought to Bangkok by it on its return. This letter
and the one cited just above were printed in the <i>Foreign
Missionary</i> for March and for May, 1870.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Till within a very short time before their execution, we
had no apprehension that any serious obstacle would be
thrown in the way of the Lāo becoming Christians. All the
baptisms had taken place publicly. The number, and some
of the names, of the Christians had been given in answer
to questions asked by the younger daughter of the king,
and by others of royal blood. We had become convinced
that the king must know that some of his people had become
disciples of Jesus. His two daughters had assured Mr.
McGilvary that no one should be molested for becoming
Christians. With such an assurance from the highest
princesses in the land, we flattered ourselves that the king
would tolerate Christianity. The fearlessness, also, with
which all but Nān Chai professed Christ, made us feel that
there was no danger to the life of any one who had received
baptism.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Nān Chai, however, seemed anxious. Some two months
before his baptism he requested us to write to Bangkok and
get the King of Siam to make proclamation of religious
toleration. Not a month before his baptism he asked me, ‘If
the king should call me and ask, “Are you a disciple of
Jesus?” would it be wrong to say “No”?’ We knew that
for some time he had loved the Saviour, but he was following
Him tremblingly. His position as overseer (ex-abbot)
of the monastery made his renunciation of Buddhism a
more noticeable event, and rendered him more liable to persecution
than some of the others. I may here state that
those who, after leaving the monastery, are appointed overseers
of the temple, are, by virtue of their position, exempt
from the call of their masters to do government work. Nān
Chai belonged to this class. His resignation of this post
when he became a Christian, both proved his sincerity, and
made him a mark for Buddhist hate and reproach.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Noi Sunya’s work was to tend the king’s cattle, and in
this way he performed his share of public service. He also
worked a farm, and was a physician. He was of a genial
disposition and cheerful temper, always looking on the bright
side of life, happy himself, and trying to make others happy.
He was thus a general favourite. His reception of the
truth was hearty and childlike. How his face beamed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>joy that communion Sabbath! Next day, Monday, September
6th, about noon, he started for his walk of nine
miles across the plain to Mê Pō Kā. In bidding him good-bye
we little thought we should see his face no more.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Our teacher, Nān Chai, came in the following Thursday,
somewhat sad because the head man of his village was urging
him for some government work and supplies that were then
being raised for the army. After resigning the oversight of
the temple, being virtually without a master, he had come in
to the city to put himself under the king’s younger daughter.
On Saturday morning, the 11th, she gave him his protection
papers, for which he paid the usual three rupees.
Some ten days before, when Mr. McGilvary had called with
him in reference to this matter, he had, at the princess’
request, made a statement of his Christian faith, even to
the repeating of a prayer.</p>

<p class='c027'>“On that same Saturday afternoon a message came from
the head man of the village for Nān Chai’s immediate return
home. The message was so urgent that he concluded not to
wait for the accustomed Sabbath morning worship. Knowing
that there was a disposition on the part of some of the
public officers to find fault with the Christians, I thought it
best for him to go home, and not return to us till quiet
should be restored. He seemed very sad, and said that his
master was disposed to oppress him. All that I could say did
not rouse him from his depression. He took leave of us
about ten o’clock at night. When we awoke on Sabbath
morning, he was gone. We know now that shortly after
the princess had given him her letters of protection on
Saturday morning, she despatched a messenger to the head
man of the village ordering Nān Chai’s arrest. Imagine
that Sabbath morning’s walk of nearly nine miles, much of
the way through water nearly knee-deep! Dear gentle
heart, full of care and fear!</p>

<p class='c027'>“He reached home about noon. After dinner he called
upon the head man of the village; but no one knew the
nature of the conference. He was permitted to sleep at
home that night. Next morning came the order from the
chief man of the district for the overseers of the temples
and those doing the king’s own work to appear at his house.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>This order included, of course, both our brethren, Noi Sunya
and Nān Chai. But to make their attendance doubly sure,
armed men were sent with clubs and pikes to conduct them
to the appointed rendezvous. Noi Sunya took leave of his
wife and six children in tears. He knew what that call
and those clubs and spears meant. When they reached the
house of the district chief, they found a large armed force
ready to receive them. When arrested at their homes
they had been charged with refusing to do the king’s work.
But now Nān Chai was asked, ‘Are you an overseer of a
temple?’ He answered, ‘I was, but am not now.’ ‘Have
you entered the religion of the foreigners?’ ‘Yes.’ Noi
Sunya was asked the same question, to which he also answered
‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c027'>“They were then seized, and after further examination
were told that they had been condemned to death. While
Nān Chai was giving the reason of the faith that was in
him, one of the examiners kicked him in the eye, leaving
it bloodshot and causing it to swell till the eye was closed.
The arms of the prisoners were tied behind their backs.
Their necks were compressed between two pieces of timber
(the death-yoke) tied before and behind so tightly as painfully
to impede both respiration and the circulation of the
blood. They were thus placed in a sitting posture near a
wall, and cords were passed through the holes in their ears
and tied to a beam above. In this constrained and painful
position—not able to turn their heads or bow them in slumber—they
remained from Monday afternoon till Tuesday
morning about ten o’clock, when they were led out into the
jungle and executed.</p>

<p class='c027'>“When Nān Chai was arrested, his wife started on a run
to inform us, supposing that he would be brought to the
city to undergo a regular trial. In that case she hoped the
missionaries could ensure his release. She had arrived in
sight of our house, when a messenger from the head man
of the village overtook her, and informed her that if she
called on us, it would be at the risk of her life. She returned
immediately, to join him at the district chief’s house;
but was informed that if she made the least demonstration
of grief, she too would be put to death. She sat down by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>her husband for a time. They conversed together as opportunity
offered, being narrowly watched by the merciless
guard. The prisoners both said, ‘Oh, if the missionaries
were here, we should not have to die!’ Nān Chai’s last
words to his wife were, ‘Tell the missionaries that we die
for no other cause than that we are Christians.’ One of the
guards angrily asked what he had said. She saw that it was
best for her to retire, and they parted.</p>

<p class='c027'>“When Nān Chai knew that he and his comrade were
doomed, he said to one of the officers, ‘You will kill us; we
are prepared. But I beg you not to kill those who are in
the employ of the missionaries. They are not Christians,
and are not prepared to die.’ What a triumph of faith in
this once fearful disciple! What a noble forgetfulness of
self in that earnest request for the lives of others!</p>

<p class='c027'>“And now, after a long and weary night of painful
watching, the morning of Tuesday, the 14th, dawns upon
them. The hour is come. They are led out into the lonely
jungle. They kneel down. Nān Chai is asked to pray. He
does so, his last petition being, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit.’ The tenderness of the scene melts his enemies to
tears. The heads of the prisoners—prisoners for Jesus’
sake—are drawn back by slightly raising the cruel yoke they
have worn for more than twenty hours. The executioner
approaches with his club. Nān Chai receives the stroke on
the front of the neck. His body sinks to the ground a corpse.... Noi
Sunya receives upon the front of his neck five or
six strokes; but life is still not extinct. A spear is thrust into
his heart. His body is bathed in blood, and his spirit joins
that of his martyred brother. Their bodies were hastily
buried. Their graves we may not yet visit....</p>

<p class='c027'>“Only a few days before his death Nān Chai wrote, at
Mrs. Wilson’s request, a little slip which she forwarded to her
friends as a specimen of the Lāo language. The last line—the
last, no doubt, that he ever wrote—contained the following
words ‘Nān Chai dai rap pen sit lêo. Hak Yēsū
nak’ (Nān Chai has become a disciple. He loves Jesus
much).”</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c010'>X<br /> <br />THE ROYAL COMMISSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>After the despatch of our hurried notes by the
Burmese on September 29th, 1869, we felt reasonably
sure that our friends would learn the
news of our situation, and we were in a measure relieved.
But at that time we still believed the reports
about the murder of Lung Puk. In fact, it was these
reports, which we had just heard before writing the
letters sent by the Burmese, that caused the great
anxiety expressed in them. But though we poured out
our hearts and unburdened our fears to our friends,
no one in Chiengmai outside of our two families ever
knew the fears that agitated our breasts. For two
months or more we still feared that we might be
treacherously murdered under colour as though it were
done by robbers or dacoits. We knew not on lying
down at night what might happen before dawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the hardest things of the situation was that,
in the presence of our own dear children, we felt
obliged to speak to each other of these matters by
signs alone, since it seemed wise to conceal our fears
from them. When we had native callers, or in our
visits to the natives, we preached to them just as if
nothing had happened. Some that we know were
sent as spies to see what we were doing and what we
were planning to do, had nothing to report except the
Gospel message which they had heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then was the time when a few tried friends endeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>themselves forever to us. Among these was
the Princess Būa Kam, and the abbot of the Ūmōng
monastery, both of whom have been mentioned before.
The silver plate with a little rice or fruit from the
Princess never ceased to come; and the abbot often
made an excuse of errands elsewhere in our neighbourhood
that he might have occasion to call and express
his sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>One incident which occurred before the various
rumours had been cleared up, though well-nigh tragic
at the time, seemed afterward amusing enough. After
the appalling treachery of the younger daughter of
the Prince in regard to Nān Chai, while professing
constantly such personal friendship for us, we naturally
regarded her with profound distrust. What, then,
was our surprise, when, one night in the darkest time
of our troubles, a summons came for me to go at once
to her palace with the officer who brought the message.
I was by no means to wait till morning, and I
could get no clue to the object of the summons. But
it was almost a royal command. Whatever it might
mean, nothing would be gained by refusal; so I promised
at once to go. But a difficulty arose. My wife
positively refused to let me go alone. If the worst
were to come, she would be there to see it.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the children were left in bed, and off we walked
three-fourths of a mile in the dark to the palace. We
found it brilliantly lighted up. Was it for the final
act? But our fears were soon allayed. The Princess
received us as she always had done—probably a little
surprised to see Mrs. McGilvary with me. A foreign
rug was spread for us, and soon was produced a
formidable package of documents in English, which
the Princess wanted us to translate! They were from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the court in Maulmein, and had reference to the lawsuits.
They had just arrived, and she could not wait
till morning. We glanced over them, gave her the
substance of them, and promised that if she would
send her scribe down next day, we would translate
them. She was relieved to find that there was nothing
more formidable in them—and so were we. The whole
interview did not last more than fifteen minutes; and
when ready to return, we were escorted home by
servants with lanterns.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time we had very few visitors even for medicine.
But the monasteries were always open, and we
were welcomed in nearly all the homes of the princes.
I regularly called on the Prince. When he was in a
pleasant mood, I had pleasant conversations with him.
If I found him moody or busy, I paid my respects and
retired. His elder daughter and her husband were
always pleasant, and she was always interested to talk
on the subject of religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another friendship formed the year before was then
a great comfort to us, though no one could really help
us. A wealthy Chinese, who had charge of collecting
nearly all the revenue of the government, had been
shot in the city of Lampūn, eighteen miles away. A
messenger with an elephant was sent, begging me to
come at once. It seemed at first impossible for me
to go, but finally I did so. The ball had entered below
the knee while the man was lying down, had followed
the bone, and had lodged in the soft part of the
thigh. It was extracted, and I remained there till
the patient was out of danger. The wife, a Siamo-Chinese,
was a merchant, and acted as our banker for
ten years. At this writing, the family has not yet
forgotten the service rendered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>But our hourly thoughts were directed to Bangkok.
What would be the outcome of our letters? We were
continually asked what we were going to do. Our reply
was that, of course, we intended to remain. There
was no telegraph then, nor even a monthly mail. It
was not till November 26th that the first news of what
was doing in our behalf reached us. It was brought
by messengers sent on in advance to notify the government
that a Royal Commissioner had arrived in
Lampūn, with two foreigners and a train of eighteen
elephants and fifty-three attendants. They were to be
in Chiengmai the next day. No intimation, however,
was given as to what the object of the Commission was.
But plainly it must be a matter of no slight importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early on the morning of the 27th every one was on
the alert. A body of men under the direction of an
officer were scrubbing the old sālā next door to us, for
the letter had asked that preparations be made for
the party. A prince whispered in our ears to enquire
whether we knew what the “Kā Lūang” was coming
for. But we knew as little as he did. We were so
hopeful, however, that we began to prepare for our
guests, too. The whole place seemed in an attitude of
expectancy. The sudden arrival of a Kā Lūang was
not an everyday occurrence. And then the two foreigners—two
“white kolās”!</p>

<p class='c009'>In the afternoon the curiosity of every one was gratified
by the arrival of the long train with the Commissioner
at its head. The two “white kolās” were none
other than our associates in the Siamese mission, the
Rev. N. A. McDonald, and the Rev. S. C. George.
Were ever guests more welcome! The story was soon
told of the receipt of our letters in Bangkok, and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>negotiations which had resulted in their coming with
a Royal Commissioner and with a “Golden Seal,” as
the royal letter is called. We now knew definitely that
the Commissioner had come on the business of the mission
and the treatment of the Christians. But our
brethren did not know the contents of the royal letter.
No human sagacity could yet predict what turn affairs
would take. Was the mission to be securely
established, or were we to be escorted safely out of the
country? The Commissioner immediately notified the
Prince of his arrival with the “Golden Seal,” and
awaited His Highness’ pleasure. The Prince’s curiosity
and anxiety were guarantee that there would be
no delay. Nine o’clock next morning was named as
the hour for the audience. The Commissioner notified
us to be ready. An officer was sent with a palanquin
to escort the “Golden Seal” under the golden umbrella
to the palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wilson and I, of course, joined the procession.
On reaching the grand reception hall at the palace, we
encountered such an array of princely state as we had
never before seen among the Lāo. Every prince,
princess, and officer who could come was already there.
I quote from Mr. McDonald’s official report to the
Board, dated February 2d, 1870, an account of the audience.
(<i>Presbyterian Record</i>, June, 1870.)</p>

<p class='c024'>“The next morning after our arrival the Regent’s letter
was conducted in state to the palace under the royal umbrella,
and the golden tray containing it was placed on a stand
near the middle of the hall. Very soon the king entered the
hall apparently calm, but pale with suppressed rage. We
arose and bowed to him, and then resumed our seats. The
Siamese officers, however, remained prostrate before him,
as did every other one in the hall. The king immediately
broke the seal and handed the letter to the Siamese secretary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>to read. After the reading of the letter he looked
up, evidently quite relieved, and remarked, ‘This letter does
not amount to so much. It gives the missionaries privilege
to remain if they wish, or to go if they prefer.’”</p>

<p class='c025'>Mr. McDonald, then, as a member of the Commission,
addressed the King, referring to the kindness with
which the missionaries had been received by him on
their arrival—which was in keeping with the favour
shown them in Bangkok, and with the beneficent nature
of their work—but regretting that late difficulties had
made their stay unpleasant. Among other things he
referred to the desertion of their servants. But neither
he nor the royal letter made the slightest reference
to the murder of the Christians. Mr. McDonald then
proceeds:</p>

<p class='c024'>“What I said did not seem to rouse him. He continued
to suppress his rage, and replied, ‘As to servants, he had
never placed any hindrance. He had put to death a couple
of fellows—a thing which he had a right to do, since they
had failed to do their allotted government work. But that
was his own business.’”</p>

<p class='c025'>The Prince evidently thought that the affair was
ended, and was preparing to close the audience, greatly
relieved that the one dreaded point had not been referred
to either in the letter or in the conference. But
to stop there would have been an inexcusable blunder
on our part. Not only had the good name of the Christians
been tarnished, but our own also, if we had
made all this great fuss about nothing. It was a difficult
thing to face the Prince before his whole court,
and charge him with falsehood; but he had driven us
to it. If he had not lied, we had. For once we were
called upon to stand before kings for His name’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>sake; and I believe that words were given to me to
speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that I was sorry to be compelled to say that
the Prince knew that he had not spoken the truth.
There was not a man or woman in that audience, nor
in the whole country, who did not know that those two
men had been put to death for no other pretended
reason than that they were Christians. It was done
and was proclaimed to be done as a warning to others.
They had not refused to do government work. The
charge that they had failed to get the slabs for the
stockade was a subterfuge. There was not a word of
truth in it, as the officer through whom it was done,
then present, well knew. When these men received
the order to get the slabs, they started immediately,
but were at once arrested, and were not allowed to
get them. In no sense were they dealt with as criminals.
On that very day (over three months after the
order), not one-fifth of the men in the province had as
yet brought in their timbers, and nothing was said
about it. In this country it was an unheard-of thing,
even for the gravest offences, to decoy men out from
their homes into the jungle, and to kill them there with
no pretence of a trial. There was a Sanām (Court),
there were regular officers of law, even down to the
executioner. In the case of these men, not a single
form of law had been observed. By the Prince’s own
order they had been treacherously arrested, led out into
the jungle, and cruelly clubbed to death in the presence
of a lawless mob by a ruffian hired to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man looked on me in mingled astonishment
and rage. Possibly till then he thought we had not
been able to learn the facts and particulars in the case.
More likely he thought that no one would dare thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>openly and publicly to expose them. But what was
said had the desired effect. Up to this point the
Prince’s position had been impregnable. To assault it
successfully would have required the production of
evidence; and no man in the country, high or low,
would have dared to testify against him. But this unexpected
challenge was more than he could endure.
He flung all caution to the winds. In an instant his
sole defence was abandoned. Mr. McDonald says:</p>

<p class='c024'>“‘Yes,’ he said, ‘he had killed them because they had
embraced the Christian religion. And he would continue
to kill every one who did the same. Leaving the religion
of the country was rebellion against him, and he would so
treat it. If the missionaries would remain to treat the
sick, they might do so. But they must not make Christians;
they must not teach the Christian religion. If they did,
he would expel them from the country’.... At one time
I feared that he might become uncontrollable, and break
over all restraints, and do us some personal injury. The
Siamese officer also was alarmed for our safety.”</p>

<p class='c025'>Matters now had been brought to a crisis. The
Christians had been proved to be not malefactors, but
martyrs. We now understood each other, and all
parties understood the situation. The Prince’s
bravado before the Commissioner in one sense was
politic. He had read between the lines of the King’s
letter that the Siamese were afraid of him; and he
was quite willing to have it so. On the other hand, his
attitude might have the effect of convincing them that
he was a dangerous man, to be dealt with accordingly—and
I believe it did.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as Mr. McDonald goes on to say, “It was useless
to attempt any further argument. The missionaries
merely told him that it was their intention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>remain. The conversation then turned to other subjects,
and the Prince became more calm. After returning
to the house of Mr. McGilvary, and after
anxious consultation and prayer, it was considered
best to abandon the mission for a time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Commissioner strongly advised us to withdraw.
Mr. McDonald was naturally timid, and hardly felt
safe till he was fairly out of the country. He and Mr.
George were sure that it would not be safe for us to
remain a single day after the Commissioner departed;
and Mr. Wilson agreed with them. Such, then, was
the report made to the Board, and the number of the
<i>Record</i> from which we have quoted above announced
the dissolution of the mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of the scene in the palace spread like wild-fire
over the city. We had scarcely reached home when
our neighbours and friends began to send us secret
messages that it would be foolish to remain. The
Prince was like a lion bearded in his den. When the
Commissioner left there was no telling what he might
do. The Commissioner naturally felt some responsibility
for our safety, and desired to have us return with
him. I so far consented as to allow the Commissioner
to send word to the Prince that we would retire as
soon as we conveniently could. Yet, from what I knew
of the feeling of the people toward us, I could not see
that it was the will of Providence that the mission
should be abandoned. Nor did I believe that it would
be hazardous to remain. The Prince evidently had no
thought of actually renouncing his allegiance to Siam.
He had been directed to see to our safety, if we wished
to remain. I think, too, that I understood him better
than did either our own friends or the Commissioner.
His bluster at the audience was for effect. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>more than probable that, after sober thought, he himself
would realize that he had gone too far. Before
the coming of the Commissioner he had been summoned
to Bangkok; he was at that time busy preparing boats
for the journey, and was soon to start. He was too
shrewd a man to wish us to appear there before him
as witnesses against him. It was, I thought, more
than probable that he would meet more than half-way
any advance made toward him, though we could
not expect him to make the advance himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning before breakfast Mr. Wilson came
over to have a long walk and talk with me. He did
not wish to express his fears before our children. He
argued with all his logic that it was better to go while
we safely could. His idea was to retire to Rahêng,
where we would be under the direct protection of the
Siamese government; for, after yesterday’s scene, he
was sure we never could be safe in Chiengmai. So far
as he was concerned, I thought it a good idea. He
might go, and I would remain—at least as long as I
could. He felt, however, that he would be to blame
if any disaster happened to us. From all responsibility
on that score I freely exonerated him. As I viewed
the case, our personal risk was at an end so soon as
the situation should be known in Bangkok. The
Prince would no longer dare either to do anything or
to cause anything to be done <i>secretly</i> as once we
feared he would. Therefore, notwithstanding the
bluster of the day before, fear for our personal safety
had little weight with me. But quite apart from the
question of danger, there was much to be said in favour
of Mr. Wilson’s going to Rahêng. The place was an
important one for missionary work. The result might
possibly be a station in both places, instead of in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Chiengmai alone. His departure might seem some
concession to the wishes of the Prince—would show
less determination to thwart his known will. If
there were any danger in remaining, it would be less
for one family than for two. All I wanted was time
to see the Lord’s will. At any rate, I was not willing
to depart without having an audience with the Prince
alone. Against this it was urged that the Prince had
a special grudge against me, because of the vaccination
of his little grandson, and that this would be increased
by my having angered him the day before. But of this
I was not afraid. The parents of the dear child had
begged me never to think that they blamed me for it.
As to what had happened the day before, I believed
the Prince’s respect for me was higher than it would
have been had I allowed him to bluff us with his bare-faced
lie. The result of our walk was that Mr. Wilson
agreed to have me call on the Prince the next day,
though Mr. McDonald maintained that for himself he
would not risk it.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, next morning, I called at the palace at an hour
when I knew I should find the Prince alone with his
head-wife. And, just as I expected, he received me
with unwonted cordiality. I referred to the friendship
between him and my father-in-law, Dr. Bradley;
to his cordial consent given to our coming to his country
to teach the Christian religion and to benefit his
people in other ways; to his kind reception of us when
we came; to his granting us a place for a home; and
to his many other acts of kindness. We had come to
him as friends, and I could not bear we should part as
enemies. As I had anticipated, his whole manner
showed that he was pleased at my advance. That, too,
he said, was his desire. We might remain at least till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>after his return from Bangkok, and take all the time
needed for a comfortable departure. I thanked him
for his consideration, and told him that Mr. Wilson
would probably go at once. We shook hands and
parted as if the scene in the palace had never occurred.
I had won my point. What I wanted was time, and I
had gained it. The Prince could not possibly return
in less than six months’ time—it might be much longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few days our friends left us. Having no faith
in the success of my new negotiations, or possibly
thinking that I might be caught in a trap, they reported
to the Board, as we have seen, that the mission
was broken up—as technically it was. This last turn
of affairs was merely a private arrangement between
the Prince and myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had the matter not passed beyond our power, I
doubtless should have been credulous enough, or weak
enough, to prefer that no further action should be
taken by our friends in Bangkok. I did write to Dr.
Bradley and to our mission to pursue a pacific policy,
and to show the Prince all kindness, as, indeed, I knew
they would. But I learned afterwards that their advances
were hardly received with courtesy. Mr.
George, who asked permission to send by some one of
the numerous fleet of boats some parcels to us, was
given to understand that the things would not be
needed, as the Prince expected both families to leave
Chiengmai upon his return.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c010'>XI<br /> <br />DEATH OF KĀWILŌROT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The Commissioner’s report of the attitude assumed
by the Prince showed the Siamese government
that the man in control of the northern
provinces was of a spirit and temper that might be
difficult to curb—that might at any time throw everything
into confusion. Hitherto it had been their policy
to strengthen his hands to any degree not inconsistent
with his loyalty. Siam and Burma had long
been rivals and enemies. A strong buffer-state in the
north had been a necessity to Siam. But conditions
were changed. Burma was now under English control,
and had ceased to be a disturbing factor in the problem.
A change in Siamese policy as regards the North
was inevitable.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the news of the murder of the Christians became
known in Bangkok, our friends there deferred to
the wishes of the Siamese government as expressed by
the Regent—whose goodwill to the mission and to ourselves
no one doubted. No steps, therefore, were taken
to have the United States officially represented on the
Commission. In this we believe our friends were
providentially led. But Dr. House’s letter does not
state, what was also the fact, that the United States
Consul, in whose presence the Lāo Prince had given
his official sanction to the establishment of the mission,
was anxious that the United States should be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>represented. And when that Commission so signally
failed to accomplish anything satisfactory, it was the
Consul’s turn to say to our friends, “I told you so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Because, as they themselves expressed it, of the lawless
nature of the Lāo Prince, and the consequent difficulty
of protecting foreigners so far away, our
Siamese friends would then have preferred to have us
recalled. In fact, that was their first thought. The
first draft of the letter prepared to be sent by the Commission
actually contained the stipulation that we be
safely conveyed back to Siam proper. It was only the
indomitable perseverance of Dr. Bradley—who frankly
declared that he would rather have no such letter sent
at all—that secured the omission of that clause, and
left the way open for the possible continuance of the
mission. So, when the Commission returned to Bangkok,
and it was known that the Lāo Prince was soon
to follow them. General Partridge, the United States
Consul, immediately took up the case, and insisted
that the Siamese government give guarantee for the
fulfilment of promises publicly made by its vassal in
the presence of officials of both governments. “Before
this you could say, ‘He is like a tiger in the jungle; we
cannot control him.’ But when he reaches Bangkok,
he is in your power. You can then make your own
terms regarding his return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How this negotiation was conducted, I am not aware.
But from the <i>Presbyterian Record</i> of September, 1870,
we learn that the Consul carried his point:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Dr. House sends us word that the Siamese government
has extended its protection over the missionaries in Chiengmai;
they are not to be molested in their work. As the king
of Chiengmai is tributary to Siam, this decision will no
doubt be respected. This king is not likely to live long, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>he will be succeeded by his son-in-law, a prince who has
shown a friendly interest in the missionaries. The intervention
of the Siamese government was obtained by the U. S.
Consul, Gen. Partridge, not at the instance of the missionaries,
but he took the ground of treaty stipulations between
Siam and our country, which accorded the right of protection
to American citizens.”</p>

<p class='c025'>From the <i>Foreign Missionary</i> of September, 1870,
we quote the following extract from the <i>Bangkok Summary</i>,
doubtless from the pen of Dr. Bradley:</p>

<p class='c024'>“I am very happy to learn from the most reliable authority
that His Grace the Regent has been pleased to commit the
American citizens in Chiengmai to the care and protection
of the Maha Uparāt, the son-in-law of the king, charging
him to assist, nourish, and protect them so that they shall
suffer no trouble and hindrance in their work from persecutions
like those through which they have passed since September
12th last.</p>

<p class='c027'>“His Grace, moreover, is understood to have promised that
he will certainly arrange to have those American citizens
protected in Chiengmai according to the stipulations of the
treaties, even though the present king should live and continue
his reign.</p>

<p class='c027'>“The Maha Uparāt enjoys the reputation of being a mild
and discreet prince. He received this his new title a few
weeks since from His Majesty the Supreme King of Siam,
by virtue of which he is constituted Second King of Chiengmai.
I learn that His Grace the Regent has virtually committed
the rule of that kingdom to him during the illness of
the king, and has assured him that he is ultimately to
become the king’s successor to the throne.</p>

<p class='c027'>“This I regard as good news, indeed, and too good to
be held a day longer from the public. Who will not agree
with me that the Siamese government is worthy of a great
meed of praise for what it has done in the matter of the
Chiengmai mission? But let us see to it that the King of
Kings, as well, receives our highest praise for all these
gratifying events of His providence.”</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>While the Consul was pressing these claims, Prince
Kāwilōrot, as was intimated in the last extract, became
dangerously ill. He was stricken with almost
instantaneous loss of consciousness, and complete
paralysis of speech. Meanwhile we in Chiengmai, only
five hundred miles away, were in profound ignorance
of what was happening. If we had despatched a special
messenger thither for news, it would have been
three months before he could have returned with a reply.
And the first news we received was not reassuring.
Word came that the time was set for the Prince’s
return; that he had been promoted to higher honours,
and had received higher titles; that he was returning
with full power, and probably flushed with fresh victories.
Of course, that did not necessarily mean very
much. Siam understood perfectly the great trick of
oriental statecraft, the giving of high-sounding titles,
with, perhaps, a larger stipend, in compensation for
the loss of real power. But it was a time of great
anxiety for us. Revenge was a passion which that
man seldom left ungratified. Would he come breathing
out slaughter against the church and vengeance
on us?</p>

<p class='c009'>By and by there came a message stating that the
Prince was ill, and directing that offerings be made for
his recovery. Then came news that he was already
on his way, and had sent orders for a hundred elephants
to meet him at the landing station below the
rapids. Some surmised that his illness was feigned
in order to escape the lawsuits which were pressing
him. About the middle of June we learned that he
had reached the landing station, but was very seriously
ill. It was still more urgently enjoined that his relatives
and the monasteries in Chiengmai should “make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>merit” in his behalf, and propitiate the demons by generous
offerings.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the evening of June 29th, while riding through
the streets of the city, some one called out to me,
“The Prince is dead!” No news ever gave me such a
shock. I stepped in to the residence of one of the
princes, a nephew of Kāwilōrot, to get the particulars,
but found him in a dreadful state of mind. Yes. The
Prince was dead; and word had come that he (the
nephew) was to go to Bangkok to bear the brunt of the
lawsuits—to answer in his own name for transactions
done by order of the dead Prince!</p>

<p class='c009'>How soon the strongest prejudices fade and disappear
in the presence of death! The anxious fears
of his return that had haunted us, all dissolved into
tender sympathy now that he was gone. We forgot
his treachery and cruelty, and thought only of his interesting
human qualities. We recalled his taking tea
or dining with us, and even the dry jokes that he so
much enjoyed. He was a tender father. He could be
a warm, though a fickle and inconstant friend. In
many respects he was a good ruler. He was absolute
and tyrannical; but there was no petty thieving in his
realm. And now that voice that had made thousands
tremble was silent in death! No doubt it was with a
sigh of relief that the Siamese government turned over
the government of the North to one whom they could
better trust.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it would be a hard heart that could follow unmoved
that long, weary homeward trip of the dying
Prince. He was so weak that he could not endure the
jarring caused by the use of the setting-poles. His boat
had to be taken in tow of another. When the last
lingering hope of life died out, his one desire was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>reach home—to die in his own palace. The trip
through the rapids he could not bear, and it was too
slow for the dying man. Travel by elephant is both
rough and slow. He is brought ashore, therefore, and
borne on a litter as swiftly as relays of men can carry
him. Over the mountains and up the valley of the
Mê Ping, under burning sun and through driving rain,
they hasten. At last, on the evening of June 28th, they
halt on the left bank of the Mê Ping, with only that
stream between him and his own country. “What
land is this?” he asks. “Lampūn,” is the reply.
“Carry me across quickly!” He is obeyed, but sinks
exhausted by the fatigue of crossing. He passes a
restless night. His mind wanders. He dreams of being
at home; of worshipping in his own palace. The
morning comes. He is still alive; but so weak that, in
spite of his eagerness to hasten on, at every few paces
his bearers must halt, while attendants fan him or
administer a cordial. At last fan and cordials fail.
The litter is set down under the two golden umbrellas
that screen it from the burning rays of the sun. The
little group stand with bowed heads and hushed hearts
while the spirit takes its flight, to appear before its
Maker.—Almost, but not quite home, and with none
of his immediate kin by him to see the end! The attendants
cover the body with a cloth, and hasten on to
the next station, a few miles below the city. The procession
halted there at about the very time that the
messenger reached Chiengmai with the news that he
was dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such, as I learned next day from the attending
prince, were the last hours of His Highness Chao
Kāwilōrot Suriyawong, Prince of Chiengmai. He died
at ten o’clock in the morning of June 29th, 1870, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the seventieth year of his age, and in the sixteenth of
his reign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning before breakfast I was sent for by the
younger daughter of the Prince, to go to the residence
of the nephew, whom I had left late in the evening
before in such a distracted state of mind. How
shocked was I on entering to find the prince cold and
dead! The Princess wished to get my judgment
whether he was really dead beyond all hope of resuscitation.
But it required no skilled physician to answer
that question. He had evidently died by a dose
of opium administered by his own hands. The little
cup from which it was taken was still by his bedside.
Whether it was intentional suicide to escape the lawsuits
of his deceased master, or was simply designed
to ease the mental troubles of that night, they could
tell as well as I. In either case, he slept the sleep
that knows no waking till the summons of the last
trump.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast I rode out to the encampment, only
two or three miles away, where the body of the Prince
was lying. The family and officers and friends were
assembled to look for the last time on that noted face.
The last act before placing the body in the coffin was
to cover it throughout with gold-leaf, to give it the appearance
of being a Buddha. But no gold-leaf could
disguise that face. The family remained there a few
days, partly for the much-needed rest, but chiefly to
await a day of good augury for carrying the remains
to the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was well chosen for such a pageant as the
country had not seen, to honour alike the departed,
and to welcome the succeeding Prince. There was a
long and imposing procession of soldiers, monks, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>people marching to the wailing of the funeral dirge and
to the slow, solemn beat of drums. Near the head of
the line, on his elephant, was the son-in-law, Chao Intanon,
soon to be Prince of Chiengmai. Not far behind
came the body of the dead Prince, borne on a
golden bier and accompanied by a large train of yellow-robed
priests. Behind this was the vacant throne,
and on it the royal crown, both testifying to the emptiness
of human pomp and power. Then came one leading
the horse His Highness used to ride; and next, his
favourite elephant, its huge body covered with trappings
of gold. After these came members of the
Prince’s family and other near relatives.</p>

<p class='c009'>About ten o’clock the procession approached the city
which, by inexorable custom, may never open its gates
to receive the dead—not even though the dead were he
whose word for so many years had been its law. What
a comment on human glory and on the tyranny of superstitious
custom! On reaching the South Gate,
therefore, the procession turned to the right, and
passed on outside the city wall to the East Gate.
There, in the Prince’s summer garden, beside the river,
his remains lay in state until the great cremation ceremony
a year later. Meantime a lamp was kept burning
at the head and at the foot night and day. A
prince was in constant attendance. Courses of monks
chanted the requiem of the Buddhist ceremonial for the
dead. At intervals during the whole night the beat
of the drum resounded through the air, reminding
the city that there lay all that remained of one of its
greatest masters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prince Intanon, though not yet officially installed,
assured me, as soon as I met him at the encampment,
that we were to remain and build our houses and prosecute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>our work without let or hindrance. Other
princes and officers were pleased to give the same assurance.
With the Prince’s party there came a large
mail from friends in Bangkok, giving full particulars
of the negotiations that were stopped by the sudden
illness of the Prince, and clearing up the questions
about which we were so much in doubt. The interposition
of Providence had been so marked that we could
only stand in awe before Him who had so wonderfully
led us. For, after the utmost stretch of my own
credulity in trying to trust the Prince, my final conviction
is that, had he lived, he and the mission could
not have existed in the same country. He could never
have endured to see his people becoming Christians—Not
that he cared so much for Buddhism; but it
would have been a constant challenge to his autocratic
rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>In March, while the scenes of this tragic drama were
slowly enacting in Bangkok, and while we were
anxiously awaiting the dénouement, we had a pleasant
episode of another kind. One morning we were surprised
to learn from some natives that out on the plain,
not far from the city, they had passed two white foreigners,
a man and a woman, and that they were coming
to our house. Sure enough, about ten o’clock, who
should ride up but Rev. and Mrs. J. N. Cushing of the
American Baptist Mission in Burma! What an unexpected
pleasure! For three years we had seen but
two white faces outside of our own little circle. Some
of our latest news from home friends was eleven months
old when we received it. What a social feast we did
have!</p>

<p class='c009'>They had started from Shwegyin, Burma, had made
a tour west of the Salwin River, crossed over to Keng
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Tung, come down by Chieng Sên and Chieng Rāi, and
now called at Chiengmai on their way back to Burma.
Their visit was a real godsend to us in the time of our
troubles.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c010'>XII<br /> <br />THE NEW RÉGIME</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>One of the results of the change of government
was that we were able to build permanent
houses. For three years and more we had
lived within basket-woven bamboo walls that a pocketknife
could pierce, neither secure nor wholesome nor
favourable for our work. They bore silent but steady
testimony that we ourselves did not regard our stay
as permanent. The results of our manner of living
were already seen in the impaired health of the members
of the mission. My wife surely could never have
lived another decade in the old sālā with bamboo walls
and ceiling, where the dust from the borers in the
wood constantly filled the air and poisoned the lungs.
Mrs. Wilson bore up bravely for five years, until there
was just ready for her reception the permanent house
which she was never to enjoy. As soon as they could,
the family started for the United States on furlough,
all thoroughly broken down. After two years of rest
Mr. Wilson alone was able to return to the field, leaving
Mrs. Wilson behind. She never regained her health,
and they never saw each other again. Her departure
was a great loss to the mission. She was a gifted
lady, a fine vocal and instrumental musician, and a
consecrated missionary. She left one literary work in
Lāo, the translation of Bunyan’s <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,
which has since been published.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>But as matters then were, there was much perplexing
work to be done before we were at all ready to begin
building. I was favoured in getting a lot of first
class teak logs delivered at a very cheap rate. Then
the trouble began. The logs must be hauled up from
the river by elephants to the lot where they are to be
sawn. The log is raised and mounted on two strong
trestles. A black line to guide the saw is struck on
either side. Two sawyers stand facing each other
across the log, grasping the handles of a long framed
saw with horizontal blade. Then the operation begins.
The saw is pushed and pulled back and forth till the
cut is carried through to the end of the log. This
operation is repeated for every stick of timber put
into the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we are already too fast. Where are the sawyers
to come from? There were then no good sawyers
among the Lāo. No one dared to learn for fear of being
appropriated by the Prince, or of being compelled
to work on public buildings. There were, however,
three pairs of sawyers, debtors to the Prince, whom he
had brought up from Rahêng for his own work.
Whenever not needed by him or by some other person
of rank, they were allowed to seek employment elsewhere.
So, at odd times, I was able to secure their
services. But if the Prince needed them, they must at
once drop everything and go. Scores of times our
sawyers were called away, often for weeks at a time,
and at the busiest stage of the work.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now for the carpenter. The Lāo dared not be
known as carpenters for the same reason as that given
above in the case of the sawyers. They would have
been constantly requisitioned for government work.
There was in the place only one Siamese carpenter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>reputed to be a good workman. In order to get him,
I had to advance him three hundred rupees, professedly
to pay a debt, but most likely to gamble with. He was
to build by contract. But he had already received
his money, or so much of it that he was quite independent.
He soon slashed and spoiled more timber
than his wages were worth. So, to keep him from
ruining the whole, I had to get rid of him, even at
some sacrifice. Just then a Siamo-Chinese turned up,
who took the job by the day under my direction, to be
assisted by some Christians whom we trained thus as
apprentices. The house was built on the plan of the
East Indian bungalow—raised ten feet from the ground
on posts, with single walls and a veranda all round.
Its large lofty rooms, screened on all sides by the
verandas, make it still one of the most comfortable
houses in the mission. It was more than eight years
from the time of our arrival when we entered it; and
even then it was not finished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the new government was friendly, yet
some of the ruling spirits were in their hearts as hostile
as the deceased Prince had ever been, and without his
more noble qualities. There were two in particular
who soon began to show that their secret influence
would be against the mission—and their open hostility,
too, so far as they ventured to let it appear. One
was the adopted son of the late Prince, and the other
the new ruler’s half-brother, who had been made
Uparāt, or second in power, when the new Prince
ascended the throne. Had these both lived, their combined
influence would have been nearly as formidable
as that of Kāwilōrot. Unfortunately, too, the actual
business of the country was largely in their hands.
Prince Intanon was not at all ambitious for power.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>He liked nothing better than to work without care or
responsibility in his own little workshop, making fancy
elephant-saddles, and let his half-brother rule the country.
During the following year the adopted son went
down to Bangkok to receive the insignia of his new
rank, but never returned. His death was even more
sudden than that of his foster-father. He was taken
with the cholera, and died in a few hours. This left the
elder of the two avowed enemies of Christianity, and
the higher in rank and power. To give an illustration
of the kind of spirit we had to contend with in him, I
will anticipate an incident of a few years later.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two native Karens, ordained ministers, were sent by
the American Baptist Mission to initiate in Lāo territory
a work among the Karens, a hill-people scattered
sparsely throughout all the mountain region between
Siam and Burma. The native evangelists
brought with them letters from the missionaries in
Burma, requesting us to aid them in getting Lāo passports.
We went with them to the new Prince, and he
very graciously gave direction to his brother to see
that passports were issued, stating not only that the
visitors were to be protected and aided as travellers,
but also that they were to be allowed to teach the new
religion, and that people were allowed to embrace it
without fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was specially interested that they should succeed
in the first village which they were to visit, for it was
the one where I had vaccinated the whole population
during the first year of our mission. Since I had
failed to make Christians of them—partly, as I supposed,
on account of my ignorance of their language,
but more on account of the persecution which followed
so soon after—I hoped that when the message
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>was delivered in their own tongue, with official permission
to embrace it, the whole village might accept
the Gospel. What was the astonishment of the
preachers that, instead of being received with the characteristic
hospitality of their race, they hardly found
common civility! At last they learned the reason.
The Chao Uparāt had secretly despatched a special
messenger with a letter under his own seal, forbidding
any Karen subject to embrace the new religion.
All who did so were to be reported to him. What
that meant, or what he wished them to infer that it
meant, was well understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our readers, therefore, will not be surprised that
we found it necessary to keep an eye on the Chao
Uparāt, and to use considerable diplomacy in counteracting
his schemes against the church. It was my
policy in those days to keep up as close an acquaintance
as possible with the members of the ruling family.
It was the misfortune of all of them that they
were ignorant;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c020'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and ignorance begets suspicion. Some
of them were naturally suspicious of the missionaries.
They could not understand what motive could induce
men who were neither government officials nor
merchants, to leave a great country and come to live in
theirs.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f9'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This same Uparāt, whose word ruled the country, was unable to
write his own orders.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Two objects were gained by keeping in contact with
the rulers. They saw, then, with their own eyes, and
heard with their own ears, what we were doing. In
nearly every interview our one great work was magnified
alike to prince, priest, and people. I have heretofore
specially mentioned princesses, too, as well as
princes, in this connection, because the Lāo have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>proud pre-eminence among non-Christian races in the
position accorded to woman. In the family, woman’s
authority is universally recognized. At the time we
speak of it was much the same in the government also.
The influence of women in affairs of state was doubtless
greatly increased during the previous reign, when,
there being no sons in the royal household, the
daughters naturally became more prominent. They
were trained to understand and to deal with public
business.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have already referred to the kindness of the elder
daughter, now not, as in former reigns, the head-wife,
but the only wife of the new ruler. By birth she was
of higher rank than he; and she was in every way
worthy of the high position she now assumed. Hers
was, in fact, the strong intelligence and steady will
that kept her more passive consort from errors into
which he would otherwise have been led. At this particular
juncture she was needed as a check against
the Prince’s more ambitious and less principled half-brother.
She had a woman’s instinct to discern a
point, and a woman’s revulsion against lawless acts,
even when done by her own father. In honesty of
purpose she and her consort were one, for his kindness
of heart had drawn to him more dependents than
any other prince in the land possessed. The murder
of the Christians they both regarded as “worse than a
crime—a blunder.” For the present, however, there
was no indication of the sinister forces which came
into play later. All in authority seemed to be honestly
carrying out the orders from Bangkok concerning
the missionary work.</p>

<p class='c009'>A year was spent in preparation for the ceremonies
attending the cremation of the dead Prince. During
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the last three months of this time, everything else in
the whole land yielded place to it. Not only was there
requisition of men and materials throughout the province
of Chiengmai; but all the neighbouring states furnished
large levies of men under the personal direction
of their princes or officers of rank. Such occasions
offer exceptional opportunities for meeting people from
all parts of the country, for forming lasting friendships,
and for sending some knowledge of the Gospel
to distant provinces. In after years I never made a
tour on which I did not encounter friends whose acquaintance
I had made at the great cremation festival.</p>

<p class='c009'>The preparations were hastened somewhat because
of the unsettled state of the country. Chao Fā Kōlan,
the Ngīo freebooter of whom we have already heard,
was still at his old tricks. Emboldened by the death
of the Prince, and the confusion incident to the change
of rulers, he had become more insolent than ever.
Villages had been burned within less than a day’s
march from the city. Bands of men, euphemistically
called an army, were levied and despatched to capture
him; but long before they could reach him, he was
safe within his stronghold in the mountains.</p>

<div id='i146'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>A CREMATION PROCESSION</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The dead Prince was born on a Sunday; therefore
every important event of his life must take place on
that day, even to the last dread summons, which is
not under man’s control—and beyond that, to the
final disposition of his mortal remains. Sunday,
therefore, was the first day of the ceremonies. On
that day the body was removed from the summer garden
to the “Mēn,” where it was to lie in state to receive
the homage of his relatives and subjects until
the following Sunday. The morning of each day was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>devoted to “merit-making” of various kinds—feeding
the monks, making offerings to them, and listening
to the reading of the sacred books. The afternoons
were largely spent in boxing games, a favourite amusement
of the Lāo. The evenings were given up to
gambling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything went on according to programme until
Thursday morning, when the festivities were rudely interrupted.
Chao Fā Kōlan, the bandit chief, taking
advantage of the occasion, made one of his sudden
forays to within so short a distance of Chiengmai that
he actually had posted on the city gates during the
night an insolent manifesto to the effect that the assembled
Princes need not trouble themselves further
with the cremation of the dead Prince. He and his
band would attend to that! The news produced a
tremendous panic. The whole business of the cremation
was incontinently stopped. A force was sent out
after the marauder—with the usual result. Before the
end of the week, however, the panic had sufficiently
subsided to permit the ceremonies to be resumed. The
cremation itself was carried out on the following Sunday
as planned.</p>

<p class='c009'>During all these years the demand for medical treatment,
and the opportunity which its exercise brings,
had been constantly growing. I made, for example,
a second trip to Lampūn, this time at the call of the
Chao Uparāt of that city. The poor man had consumption,
and at first sent to me for some foreign
medicine, thinking that would surely cure him. Judging
from his symptoms as reported, I sent word that I
could not cure him; that the soothing mixture which
I sent was sent in hope that it might give him a few
nights’ rest; but that was all I could do. Presently he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>sent an elephant with a most urgent appeal that I come
to see him. I was glad of the call, for it gave me the
opportunity of directing a dying man to something
even more urgently needed than medicine. I spent
a few days with him, and visited all of the leading
families and officials of the place, establishing most
valuable and friendly relations with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long before this time, both the demand for medical
treatment and the responsibility involved far exceeded
what any person without complete professional
training could undertake to meet. We had urged
upon our Board the claims of our mission for a physician.
The following touching appeal, which appeared
in the <i>Foreign Missionary</i> for March, 1870, was made
by Mr. Wilson not long after the death of his son
Frank. After sending an earnest appeal from Nān
Inta for helpers, Mr. Wilson says:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Of course Nān Inta’s call for help includes in it a
Christian physician. Who will respond? I am convinced
there are many young men in the medical profession whose
love for Jesus and whose sympathy with human sufferings
are strong enough to bring them all the way to Chiengmai,
if they will but yield themselves to this constraining influence.
Christian physician, you are greatly needed here. The
missionary’s family needs you. This suffering people needs
you. You were needed months since, when a voice so sweet
and full of glee was changed to piteous shrieks of pain. You
were not here to give relief; and if you now come, it will
not greet you, for it is hushed in death. You are needed
here <i>now</i>. A plaintive cry comes to me as I write. It is the
voice of our dear babe, whose weak condition fills our hearts
with deepest anxiety. May I not interpret this plaintive
cry as addressed to you? It is the only way that M. has
of saying to you, ‘Come to Chiengmai.’ When you arrive,
she may be sleeping beside her little brother. But you will
find others, both old and young, whose pains you may be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to soothe, and whose souls you may win from the way that
leads to eternal death.”</p>

<p class='c025'>Great was our joy, therefore, when, in the summer
of 1871, we learned that Dr. C. W. Vrooman, from
Dr. Cuyler’s church in Brooklyn, had responded to
our appeal, and already was under appointment of our
Board for Chiengmai. His arrival was delayed somewhat
because it was thought unsafe for him to make
the river trip during the height of the rainy season.
So it was January 22d, 1872, before we welcomed
him to Chiengmai. He came with high credentials as a
physician and surgeon with experience both in private
and in hospital practice. He began work on the day
of his arrival. He found Nān Inta at the point of
death from acute dysentery; and his first trophy was
the saving of that precious life. Had he done nothing
else, that alone would have been well worth while.
One or two operations for vesical calculus gave him
such a reputation that patients came crowding to him
for relief. In his first report he writes:</p>

<p class='c024'>“I was very glad to commence work as soon as I arrived
in the field. The number was large of those who came to
the brethren here for daily treatment; and such is the reputation
which they have established for themselves as physicians,
that the demand for our professional services is greater
than we can properly meet. I am satisfied that the demand
for a medical missionary here was not too strongly urged
by the brethren in their earnest appeals to the Board.</p>

<p class='c027'>“I have already had much professional work to do, and
while I am ministering to physical ailments, Brother McGilvary,
who is kindly my interpreter, has opportunity to
break unto many the bread of life.... Two men have
just left who came a long distance, hoping we could bring
to life a brother who had died hours before.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c010'>XIII<br /> <br />EXPLORATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Not long after Dr. Vrooman’s arrival it was decided
to undertake our first extended tour. It
was important to ascertain the size and population
of our whole field; and this could be accomplished
only by personal exploration. A journey for
this purpose would, of course, afford abundant opportunity
for preaching the Gospel; it would, besides,
give the doctor a needed change, and would effectually
advertise his work. Our objective was Lūang Prabāng,
then one of the largest of the provinces of Siam, as it
was also the most distant one. A journey to it seemed
the most profitable that could be made during the time
at our disposal, and the most comfortable as well,
since a large stretch of it could be made by boat. It
was already too late in the season to accomplish all
that we desired; but “half a loaf is better than no
bread.” It might be years before a longer trip could
be made. As a matter of fact, it was sixteen years before
I visited Lūang Prabāng again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prince gave us a passport, sending us as his
guests to be entertained without expense; though, of
course, we always paid our way. Our letter stated
that we went as teachers of religion and as physicians
for the sick. It was a virtual proclamation for all
the sick to apply to us for treatment. This gave frequent
occasion for retort that we did not remain long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>enough to comply with our letter. We could only reply
by pointing to the clouds and the long journey
ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The party consisted of Dr. Vrooman, myself, a cook,
a body-servant, and eight carriers, with a newly-baptized
convert as the only available assistant in the
religious work. The elephants required for our transportation
over the first stage of our journey—to Chieng
Rāi—we had secured, for a wonder, without effort, and
very cheaply. Their owner was anxious to get them
out of the country to escape an epidemic which then
was prevalent. The start was on April 15th, 1872, after
a heavy storm which ushered in the rainy season. This
was my first trip over the road to Chieng Rāi, afterwards
so familiar to me. After leaving the plain of
Chiengmai, the road ascends the valley of the Mê
Kūang River, fording that stream no less than forty-nine
times before it reaches the summit, 3100 feet
above sea-level, the watershed between the Mê Ping
and the Mê Kōng.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c020'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Thence it descends to the Mê Kok
at Chieng Rāi. The owner of our elephants travelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>with us, and was unnecessarily tender to his beasts.
In consequence we were ten days making this stage
of the trip, which afterwards, with my own elephants,
I used to make in less than six. On this trip I walked
almost the whole distance.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f10'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In standard Siamese the vowel in the name of this great river is
undoubtedly long o, and has been so since the days of the earliest
Siamese writing. Such also seems to have been the understanding
of the early travellers who first brought the name into European
use, for Mekong is the uniform spelling of all the standard Atlases
and Gazetteers which I have been able to consult. In the Lāo dialect,
however, the vowel is that represented by <i>aw</i> in <i>lawn</i>. This is
the pronunciation which Mr. J. McCarthy, Director of the Siamese
Royal Survey Department, heard in the North, and transferred to
the Map of Siam, which he compiled, as Me Kawng. This, however,
Mr. R. W. Giblin, Mr. McCarthy’s successor in office, recognized
as an error, and assured me that it should be corrected in the
new map which he hoped soon to publish. Mr. Giblin, however,
has left the service, and the map, I fear, has not yet been issued.
But since Siamese speech and the usage of geographical authorities
are at one on this point, there can scarcely be question as to the
proper form for use here—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At Chieng Rāi we were cordially received. The governor
listened to the Gospel message, and, I believe,
received it in faith, as we shall see later. Thence we
took boat down the Mê Kok to its junction with the
Mê Kōng. The sand-bar where we spent the Sabbath
was covered with fresh tracks of large Bengal tigers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shortly after this we passed out of the Mê Kok into
the great Mê Kōng, with reference to which I take
the liberty of quoting from a recent work, <i>Five Years
in Siam</i>, by H. Warrington Smyth, F.R.G.S.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Few can regard the Me Kawng without feeling its peculiar
fascination. That narrow streak connecting far countries
with the distant ocean,—what scenes it knows, what
stories it could tell! Gliding gently here, and thundering
with fury there where it meets with opposition; always continuing
its great work of disintegration of hard rocks and
of transport of material; with infinite patience hewing down
the mountain sides, and building up with them new countries
in far climes where other tongues are spoken; it never
stays its movement. How few men have seen its upper
waters! What a lonely life altogether is that of the Me
Kawng! From its cradle as the Gorgu River in the far
Thibetan highlands, to its end in the stormy China Sea, it
never sees a populous city or a noble building. For nearly
three thousand miles it storms through solitudes, or wanders
sullenly through jungle wastes. No wonder one sat by
the hour listening to its tale. For though but dull to read
of, the wide deep reality rolling before one had an intense
interest for a lonely man.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Rising in about 33° 17′ N. Lat. and 94° 25′ E. Long. in
the greatest nursery of noble rivers in the world, where six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>huge brethren have so long concealed the secrets of their
birth, it flows southeast through Chinese Thibetan territory
to Chuande, where the tea caravan road from Lhasa and
Thibet on the west, crosses it eastward towards Ta Chien Lu
and China, over 10,000 feet above sea-level.”</p>

<p class='c025'>Almost within sight from the mouth of the Mê Kok
were the ruins of Chieng Sên, once the largest city
in all this region. Its crumbling walls enclose an
oblong area stretching some two miles along the river.
Seventy years before our visit it had been taken by a
combined army of Siamese and Lāo. Its inhabitants
were divided among the conquerors, and carried away
into captivity. At the time of our visit, the city and
the broad province of which it was the capital had
been desolate for three-quarters of a century. Nothing
remained but the dilapidated walls and crumbling
ruins of old temples. Judging from its innumerable
images of Buddha, its inhabitants must have been a
very religious people. One wonders whence came all
the bronze used in making them in those distant days.
To me it was an unexpected pleasure to find myself in
that old city, the ancestral home of so many of our
parishioners. Little did I think then that twenty
years later I should aid in organizing a church where
we then stood. The Mê Kōng is here a mighty stream.
It must be a magnificent sight in time of high
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>A short distance below the city we passed a village
recently deserted because of the ravages of the
tigers. The second day from Chieng Sên brought us
to Chieng Kawng, one of the largest dependencies of
the province of Nān. There we spent two very interesting
and profitable days. I had met the governor
in Chiengmai. He was delighted with my repeating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>rifle, and had us try it before him. There was also
his son, who not long after was to succeed the father;
but his story we shall come upon some twenty years
later.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this place we were fortunate in finding an empty
trading-boat going to Lūang Prabāng, in which the governor
engaged for us passage on very reasonable terms.
We left Chieng Kawng on May 3d. The trip to Lūang
Prabāng occupied five days, and was one of the
memorable events of my life. In some respects the
scenery is not so striking as that of the Mê Ping rapids.
The breadth of the river makes the difference. You
miss the narrow gorge with overhanging cliffs and the
sudden bends closing in every outlet. But, on the
other hand, you have an incomparably greater river
and higher mountains. I quote again from Mr. Warrington
Smyth the following description of one portion
of the river scenery:</p>

<p class='c024'>“The high peaks, towering 5,000 feet above the river,
which give it such a sombre appearance, are generally of the
very extensive limestone series. They present tremendous
precipices on some of their sides, and their outlines are
particularly bold.... Some miles above Lūang Prabāng
the large and important tributaries of the Nam Ū and the
Nam Sêng enter the Mê Kawng. The clear transparent
water of these tributaries forms a strong contrast to the
brown sediment-laden water of the Mê Kawng.... In
some of the rapids with sloping bottoms, the first jump over
the edge is very pleasant; the fun then comes in the short
roaring waves. Everybody on board is fully occupied; the
men at the bow-oar canting her head this way and that,
the helmsman helping from the other end to make her take
its straight, the men at the oars pulling for all they are worth,
and the rest bailing mightily, or shouting to any one who has
time to listen. If the rapid is a bad one, the crews land to
have a meal before tackling it, and stop to chew some betel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and compare notes after it. So it is always a sociable
event.”</p>

<p class='c025'>My travelling companion, Dr. Vrooman, thus gives
his impressions.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The current of the Cambodia is very swift, in places
so much so that it was dangerous to navigate. The river is
nearly a mile wide in places; and where the channel is narrow,
it rushes along with frightful rapidity. No scenery is
finer throughout the entire distance we travelled on it.
Mountains rise from either bank to the height of three or
four thousand feet. The river fills the bottom of a long,
winding valley; and as we glided swiftly down it, there
seemed to move by us the panorama of two half-erect hanging
landscapes of woodland verdure and blossom. Only as
we neared the city did we see rough and craggy mountain
peaks and barren towering precipices.”</p>

<p class='c025'>Twenty-six years later I descended the Mê Ū River
from Mûang Kwā to Lūang Prabāng, and then ascended
it again. The perpendicular rock-cliffs at its junction
with the Mê Kōng surpass any that I ever saw elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of greater interest to me, however, than roaring
rapids and towering rocks were the evidences of
numerous human habitations perched far above us on
the mountain sides. Rarely can their houses or villages
be seen; but in many places their clearings have
denuded the mountains of all their larger growth. It
was tantalizing not to be able to stop and visit these
people in their homes. But my first opportunity to
make extensive tours among them was not till some
twenty years later. As for the Mê Kōng, my comment
is: If I wished an exciting river trip, and had a comfortable
boat, I should not expect to find a more enchanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>stretch of three hundred miles anywhere else
on the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lūang Prabāng was then the most compactly built
of all Siamese cities outside of Bangkok, which, in
some respects, it resembled. It differs from the other
Lāo cities in having no great rural population and extensive
rice-plains near it. Its rice supply was then
levied from the hill-tribes as a tribute or tax. The
city has a fine situation at the foot of a steep hill some
two hundred feet high, tipped, as usual, with a pagoda.
The Nām Kêng there joins the Mê Kōng, dividing the
city into two unequal portions. The view from the
top of the hill is delightful. The inhabitants belong
to a large branch of the Tai race, extending southward
at least to Cambodia. They are called the Lāo Pung
Khāo (White-bellied Lāo), as ours, because of their
universal practice of tattooing the body, are called Lāo
Pung Dam (Black-bellied).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prince of Lūang Prabāng was absent from the
city hunting wild elephants, in which game his province
abounds. The Chao Uparāt gave us a hospitable
welcome. Behind the city is a noted cave in a
mountain, which the natives think is the abode of
the very fiercest evil spirits. No doubt the real spirits
are the malarial germs or the poisonous gas which
later we found to be the chief danger of the Chieng
Dāo cave. It was in this cave that M. Mouhot, a
noted French scientist, contracted the fever from which
he died. The natives believed that his death was
caused by his rashness in trespassing upon the domain
of the spirits who preside over the cave. We were
astonished at some sorts of fish displayed in the
market, such as I never saw anywhere else. Mr. McCarthy
tells of assisting at the capture of one, a plā
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>buk, seven feet long, with a body-girth of four feet
and two inches, and weighing one hundred and thirty
pounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>We remained in Lūang Prabāng six days, leaving it
on May 14th. I was very loath to go so soon. The
people were eager for books as well as for medicine.
It was the one place where Siamese books were well
understood. We could have disposed of basketfuls
of the Scriptures, as Dr. Peoples did twenty-four years
later. It is one of the anomalies of the twentieth century
that when we finally were ready to establish a
Christian mission, after the country had passed from
non-Christian to Christian rulers, we could not get
permission.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Lūang Prabāng we again took boat to Tā Dûa,
some sixty miles below. There we bade good-bye to
the wonderful river, and turned our faces homeward.
Our elephants were good travellers, the swiftest we
had so far found. They gave us no chance to stroll
on in advance, and rest till they should come up, as
we had done before. They brought us to Nān in six
days, four of which were spent in travel over high
mountain ridges. Our road passed near the great salt
wells; but we had no time for sight-seeing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two experiences on this portion of the trip will not
be forgotten. One was a fall from my tall elephant.
A flock of large birds in covert near us suddenly
flew up with loud shrill cries. I was reclining in the
howdah at the time, and raised myself up to look out
under the hood, and, while suspended there in unstable
equilibrium, another and louder cry close at hand made
the beast give a sudden start backwards, which landed
me in a puddle of water. Fortunately no further damage
was done. Another annoyance, more serious, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the land-leeches which we often encountered when we
dismounted to walk. The whole ground and every
shrub and twig seemed covered with the tiny creatures.
Sensitive to the least noise, each one was holding
on by his tail, and waving his head back and forth
to lay hold of any passing animal. We soon found
that they had a special fondness for the <i>genus homo</i>.
Do what we might, every hundred yards or so we
had to stop to rub them off, while the blood ran
profusely from their bites. We had none of the herbs
which the Mūsô bind on their legs to keep them off.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Saturday evening we reached Nān, the first place
where I found friends since leaving Chieng Rāi. Chao
Borirak, whom I had met in Chiengmai, nephew of the
Nān Prince, and a few others, were soon on hand to
give us welcome and to offer any aid we needed. The
Prince was a venerable old man, with four sons—fine
men, all of them. The country was well governed,
though it long continued conservative as regards the
adoption of foreign ways and the welcoming of foreign
traders. I fell in love with Nān at first sight, and
marked it for a future mission station.</p>

<p class='c009'>On our departure from Nān, Chao Borirak accompanied
us as far as Prê, bringing his own elephants—one
of them a colt, which he rode astride like a horse—the
only one, in fact, that I ever saw so used. At Prê
we found our government letter not very effective.
Rupees, however, were effective enough to prevent any
long delay. The ruling authority in Prê has always
seemed weak.</p>

<div id='i158'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i158.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>INTERIOR OF A TEMPLE, PRÊ</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was an amusing circumstance connected with
an eclipse of the moon while we were there. Since
the conversion of Nān Inta, I had taken pains to
announce each eclipse as it was to occur. I did so in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Prê the day before it was due. The eclipse took
place early in the night, and I expected to hear the
city resound with the noise of every gun and firecracker
in the place. But everything was as quiet as
a funeral. It seemed to be regarded as <i>our</i> eclipse.
The silence may have been intended to test our assertion
that Rāhū would renounce his hold without the
noise, or possibly they were unwilling to proclaim thus
publicly the superior wisdom of the foreigner in
predicting it. At any rate, they utterly ignored it,
and let the monster have his will unmolested.</p>

<p class='c009'>My associate had gained all that could have been
expected from the tour; but an aching tooth was giving
him great trouble, and we hurried on. We reached
home on June 22d, just sixty-eight days out. We
found neither family in very good health. The doctor’s
toothache drove him to such desperation that he
insisted on my trying—all unpractised as I was—to
extract the offending eyetooth. It broke. There was
then nothing to do but to make the trip to Bangkok
for the nearest professional help. By the time he returned,
it began to be evident that he could not hope
to remain long in the field.</p>

<p class='c009'>Between Bangkok, Pechaburī, and Chiengmai, I had
been fifteen years in the field; and my wife had been
in the country from girlhood without change. We had
both endured it remarkably well, considering that we
had had the strain of starting two new stations. Before
the end of the year, however, my wife had reached
the limit of her strength, and it became necessary to
hurry her out of the country. So, on the 3d of January,
1873, she was carried in a chair to the boat, and
we embarked for the United States.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c010'>XIV<br /> <br />THE FIRST FURLOUGH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The tour of the previous season had been so
hasty and unsatisfactory, that I was very
anxious, if possible, to duplicate the homeward
stretch of it as far as Nān, then descend the Pitsanulōk
Fork to the Mênam, and so follow my family to Bangkok.
But would it be safe to leave my wife to make
the river trip without me, when she was in such weak
condition, and burdened with the care of four children,
the youngest of whom was but two years old?
I embarked and travelled with them as far as the landing
for Lampūn—where we must separate, if I were
to cross over to Nān—still uncertain as to what I
ought to do. It was then Friday. We decided to stop
there over Sunday, and see how matters looked on
Monday morning. The quiet and rest of the boat were
improving her condition somewhat; and her own
bravery made up whatever was lacking there. I had
secured a strong letter from the Prince, calling for
the best of steersmen through the rapids, and for
protection where the boat should stop for the night.
So, with some anxiety, but with strong faith that the
plan in itself so desirable would prosper, we separated—one
party going by boat down the Mê Ping, and the
other going afoot across country to Lampūn. For the
present we leave the wife and children, to hear their
report when we meet again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>My plan was to rely on getting elephants from point
to point. Elephants are always very hard to get; so
it seemed doubtful whether my confidence were faith
or presumption. But I was remarkably favoured. At
Lampūn there was not an elephant nearer than the
forests, save two of the governor’s own. I had trusted
to his friendship, and it did not fail me. I got off
in fine style next morning on the governor’s two elephants,
with a letter to all the governors on the route
directing them to see that I was supplied with whatever
I needed on the journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt strong in having with me, in the person of
Nān Inta, so wise a teacher and such a living witness
of the power of the Gospel. On our first visits it has
usually seemed wise to spend much of the time in visiting
and making known the Gospel privately to those
of reputation, as we know one wise missionary did
in old times. It is necessary to give the rulers a clear
idea of the non-political nature of our work. In order
to do this, we must show positively what our message
is—not merely that we are religious teachers, but that,
as such, we have a message different from all others,
not antagonistic or hostile to them, but supplementing
rather that which they offer.</p>

<p class='c009'>In visiting among the princely families in the old
city of Lakawn we met one most interesting case. It
was that of an aged bedridden Princess high in rank,
who received the Gospel with all readiness of mind.
By nature, habit, and grace she had been very religious.
She had in her day built temples and rest-houses, had
feasted Buddhist monks, and had fasted times without
number, in order to lay up a store of merit for the
great future. She hoped sometimes that she had
laid up a sufficient store; but the five and the eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>commands were against her. She had killed animals;
and the command is explicit, and condemns without a
saviour. That the Creator of all had made these
creatures for our use and benefit was a new idea. That
of itself would remove much of the burden on her conscience.
And as one after another of the great truths
of revelation was opened up to her, particularly the
doctrine of the incarnation and atonement of our divine-human
Redeemer, it seemed as if the burden was
lifted. Nān Inta was himself a living testimony that the
Christian teaching can and does give instantaneous
relief when simply believed. It is difficult to tell
which was more touching, the sympathetic earnestness
of the speaker, or the comfort it imparted to the
hearer. The Princess begged us to come again and
often. And neither of us found any other place so
attractive.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a week spent in Lakawn, we departed on our
way to Nān. The next Sunday we spent in the forest.
I look back with delightful memories to the occasional
Sabbaths thus spent in the deep forest after a
busy week with no rest and no privacy—a Sabbath
in solitude, away from every noise, and even every
song except the music of the wind and the song of
birds! We always had service with our men; and
then, under the shade of some cool spreading tree, or
beside a flowing brook, one could be alone and yet not
alone. No one more needs such retirement than a
missionary, whose work is always a giving-out, with
fewer external aids for resupply than others have.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Sunday we spent in Wieng Sā, the first
of the numerous little outlying towns of Nān. On
Monday we reached Nān itself, the limit of our tour in
that direction. The country was well governed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>princes intelligent, and the common people friendly.
But the special attraction that Nān had for me largely
centred around one man, the Prince’s nephew, Chao
Borirak—the one that rode astride the young elephant
to see us safe to Prê on our earlier trip, with whom
we used to talk religion about the camp-fires till the
small hours of the morning. We left him then apparently
on the border land of Christianity, with
strong hope that he soon would be ready to profess
publicly the faith which he was almost ready to confess
to us. His rank and connection would make him
of great assistance in opening a station in Nān, which,
next to Chiengmai, was the most important province
in the Lāo region. Again he offered us a warm welcome,
giving up his time to visiting with us the rulers
and the monasteries, in one of which his son had long
been an abbot. It seemed as if Nān Inta’s experience
would be all that was needed to settle his faith. At
his request I asked and received permission from the
Prince for him again to accompany us—with his young
elephant foal and her mother—five days’ journey to
Tā It, where I was to take boat. Our walks by day
and our talks by night are never to be forgotten. But
the convenient season to make a public profession never
came. He lived in hope of seeing a station in Nān, but
died not long before the station was established.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Tā It no boat was to be had either for sale or
for hire. But my face was turned toward home, and I
would have gone on a raft. I had to do the next thing—to
take a small dug-out which the Prince got for
me, and go on to Utaradit, the next town below. There
I was able to purchase a boat, which I afterwards sold
in Bangkok for what it cost me. Nān Inta was the
steersman, and my four men rowed. Our longest stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>was at Pitsanulōk, where the Siamese mission now
has a station. On reaching Bangkok I was delighted
to find that my family had made their long trip down
the other river in safety, though not without great
anxiety, and some threatened danger. Our oldest
daughter had been quite ill on the way. Once they
came perilously near falling a prey to a band of
robbers. It was only by a clever ruse of the captain
that they escaped. As soon as he caught sight of the
suspicious-looking group of men on a sand-bar ahead,
he had the gong loudly sounded. That and the waving
American flag evidently made them think that this
was the leading boat of some prince’s flotilla. They
incontinently fled into the forest. At the next stopping-place
our boatmen learned that it was, indeed,
a marauding band that had committed many depredations
on passing boats. What a merciful preservation!</p>

<p class='c009'>We spent a few weeks in Bangkok, resting and visiting
in the home of my father-in-law, Dr. Bradley, of
sainted memory. It proved to be the last time that
we ever saw him. He lived only a few months after
that.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fifteen years the world had moved. Going round
“the Cape,” even in a good clipper ship like the <i>David
Brown</i>, had become too slow. We took, instead, the
steamship <i>Patroclus</i> from Singapore to London, via
the Suez Canal. The Rev. Mr. Keyesberry, a missionary
friend of Dr. Bradley’s, had been waiting to find
an escort to England for two young sons and a
daughter. We gladly undertook that service, and so
had a flock of seven young folks to look after!</p>

<p class='c009'>We were barely under way when our own children
broke out with the measles. The disease, fortunately,
proved to be of a mild type, and our new charges were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>not hard to manage. So, on the whole, we got along
very well. In London we had unexpected trouble because
the friend who was to meet Alice Keyesberry
at the dock failed to appear, and, strangely enough, we
had received no memorandum of her destination. It
cost us two days’ search to discover her friends at the
Walthamstow Mission School.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys I had promised to convoy as far as Edinburgh.
So, leaving my family in London, I had the
great pleasure of a visit to the beautiful Scotch capital.
The day spent there was to me a memorable
one. It was, however, a matter of great regret that,
being so near the Highlands, I could not also visit the
original home of my ancestors.</p>

<p class='c009'>We arrived in New York on July 11th, 1873, after
an absence of fifteen years. Under any circumstances
fifteen years would work great changes. But that
particular fifteen had included the Civil War. The
changes in the South were heart-rending.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though North Carolina was drawn late into the
Confederacy, it is said that she furnished a larger
number per capita of soldiers and had a larger number
of casualties than any other state in the South.
The havoc among my old schoolmates and pupils, and
among my flock, was distressing. In many places, too,
the sectional feeling was still bitter. The wisest of
the people, however, were becoming fully reconciled
to the results of the war. The largest slaveholder in
my own section assured me that the freeing of his
slaves had been a boon to him, and that he was clearing
more from his old farm under free labour than
he had done before with slaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately in the churches the feeling was more
bitter. My old associate, Dr. Mattoon, had accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the presidency of Biddle Institute at Charlotte—now
Biddle University (colored). For a time he was very
coldly received except by such broad-minded men as
his old Princeton classmate, and my friend, Dr. Charles
Phillips. By virtue, however, of his noble Christian
character and his conservative bearing, Dr. Mattoon
overcame these prejudices, and lived to be welcomed
in the largest churches in the state. I spent most
of my furlough in North Carolina; and personally I
received a welcome almost as warm as if I were a missionary
of the Southern Board. Returned missionaries
were not numerous then. It was not an uncommon
thing for me to lecture in churches which had never
before seen the face of a foreign missionary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after our arrival in the United States news
came of the resignation of Dr. Vrooman; and my first
duty was to find a successor. For myself, and even for
my family, I could endure to return without one. But
I could not face the distressing appeals from the sick
whose ailments I was powerless to relieve. In my visits
among friends in North Carolina I met a young
medical graduate, Dr. M. A. Cheek, who received from
warm friends of the mission flattering recommendations
for the place. He himself was pleased with the
opening, and would willingly accept it, if he could first
take a graduate course in surgery. This was easily
arranged, and he was ready to return with us the following
summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hardest thing to face was the parting with our
children. But the bitterness of this pang was softened
by the kindness of friends which opened the best
of Christian homes and schools to receive them. We
can never sufficiently express our gratitude for the
kindness shown us in this matter by the late Mrs. E.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>N. Grant and Miss Mitchell of the Statesville Female
College, and to Mrs. McNeill, the widow of my old
pastor.</p>

<p class='c009'>These two great questions settled, we left North
Carolina in March, 1874—my wife with the two
younger children, to visit friends and relatives in the
North; and I, as I hoped, to visit the churches and the
seminaries in search of recruits. But a cold contracted
on the trip north ran into a dangerous attack
of pleuro-pneumonia, followed by a slow recovery. Thus
I missed my visits to the seminaries and the meeting
of the General Assembly in St. Louis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The return to the field was by way of San Francisco,
and we reached Bangkok on August 27th, 1874.
On November 14th a son was given us to take the
place of the children left behind. In December began
our river journey to Chiengmai. The river was
low, and we were a month and a day from Bangkok
to Rahêng. There we found four missionaries of the
Nova Scotia Baptist Board seeking to establish a station
among the Karens of Siam. But they found their
villages too small and too widely scattered to justify
the establishment of a station. So they were returning
to Burma. On Saturday night we all dined together,
and had a sociable hour. On Sunday evening
we drew up our boats side by side, and had a prayer-meeting
that we shall long remember. There was
something delightful in thus meeting and enjoying
Christian fellowship on a sand-bar, and then passing
on to our respective fields of work. Some of these
men afterwards went to India, and started the Telegu
mission, which has had phenomenal success.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were still the rapids and four more weeks
of travel before we could reach our Lāo home. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the home-coming at last was delightful. Our faithful
old coolie, Lung In, with his wife, met us in a small
boat three days’ journey below Chiengmai, with fruit
and fowls lest we should be in want. Then the tall
figure of Nān Inta, with his face like a benediction!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was February 7th, 1875, when at last we drew
up alongside our own landing-place, and felt the warm
handshake of old friends. Among the Lāo at last!—and
no place that we had seen would we exchange
for our Lāo home. For the first time since our arrival
in 1867 we had a permanent house to enter!</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>Dr. Cheek’s arrival was a matter of great rejoicing.
He was very young—only twenty-one,
in fact, on the day he sailed from San
Francisco. The trying drudgery that he and others
of our early medical missionaries had to endure, is now
in great measure obviated through the help of native
assistants. The remainder of the year 1875 I devoted
very largely to assisting in the medical work, interpreting,
helping in operations, and caring for the
souls of the numerous patients, without feeling the
weight of responsibility for their physical condition,
as I had done before. Dr. Cheek came out a single
man; but, like others before him, he lost his heart on
the way. Toward the end of that year he went down
to Bangkok, and was married to Miss Sarah A. Bradley.
He returned to Chiengmai just as Mr. Wilson was
ready to start for the United States on his second
furlough. The April communion was postponed a
week that the newly-arrived and the departing missionaries
might commune together before separating. It
was Mrs. Wilson’s last communion with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>In May, 1876, Nān Inta was ordained our first ruling
elder. The story has often been told that before his
ordination the Confession of Faith was given him to
read carefully, since he would be asked whether he
subscribed to its doctrines. When he had finished the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>reading, he remarked that he saw nothing peculiar in
its teachings. It was very much like what he had read
in Paul’s Epistles! In January Pā Kamun, the widow
of Noi Sunya, was baptized. It was thus appropriately
given to her to be the first woman received into
the communion of the church. Two of her daughters,
and Pā Peng, the wife of Nān Inta, soon followed.
Lung In was elected the first deacon, but was too modest
to be ordained to that office. Meanwhile he was
becoming a most useful assistant in the hospital.
Strange as it may seem, the office of hospital nurse is
one of the most difficult to get a Lāo to fill. Lung
In, however, was not above the most menial service for
the sick. His real successor was not found until the
present incumbent, Dr. Kêo, was trained. Dr. McKean’s
testimony is that it would be scarcely more
difficult to procure a good surgeon than to fill Kêo’s
place as nurse and assistant among the hospital patients.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the summer of 1876, in company with Nān
Inta, I made a tour among the four nearest provinces
to the north and west. The governor of Mûang Kên
had long given promise of becoming a Christian, and
now invited me to visit his people. On his frequent
visits to Chiengmai on business, he always called on
me, and no subject was so interesting to him as the
subject of religion. Before the proclamation of toleration,
while the common people were still afraid of
making a public profession of Christianity, our most
effective work was probably that with the higher class
of officials, who stood in somewhat less fear of the
known antagonism of the Chao Uparāt. They were,
besides, a more interesting class than the common
people, for they were better educated, were more accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>in their daily duties to weigh arguments and
decide on questions of evidence, and many of them had
been trained in the religious order.</p>

<p class='c009'>This governor of Mûang Kên had learned enough of
the tenets of Christianity to become unsettled and dissatisfied
with the prospects of salvation offered by a
purely ethical religion. He saw the weakness of the
foundation on which he had been taught to rely, and
the difference between the authors of the two religions.
So he stood on the border land between the two, at
the very gate, wishing to enter in, but with many obstacles
in his way, and strong opposing influences to
overcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>My first objective, then, on this tour was Mûang Kên.
The governor had asked me to come and smooth the
way for him by teaching his under-officials and his
townsmen. Nān Inta was the living, concrete argument,
and he put his whole heart into it. We had a
few days of deeply interesting work. Few, however,
saw the matter as the governor did. Most of them
“would consider it.” Some would go further and say
that they worshipped Jesus under the name of their
promised Buddha Metraya, yet to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Mûang Kên we went to Chieng Dāo, where
we visited the great cave with its famous Buddhist
shrine. Ever since Nān Inta became a Christian, he
had been anxious to test the truth of some of the
legends connected with the place—a thing he dared
not do before. The cave is the abode of the great
Lawa spirit, for fear of offending whom Prince
Kāwilōrot was afraid to allow us to build to the north
of the city bridge in Chiengmai. Chieng Dāo mountain,
which rises above the cave, is seven thousand
one hundred and sixty feet high—one of the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>peaks in all Siam, and visible from Chiengmai, some
thirty-seven miles away. One of the sources of the Mê
Ping River, twenty feet wide and knee-deep, flows
bodily out from the cave. Since no animal is allowed
to be killed in so sacred a place, the stream abounds
in a great variety of beautiful fish waiting for the
food which no visitor fails to give them. The scramble
for it is as interesting to watch as the performance of
the sea-lions at San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>The legend is that no one can cross the stream inside
the cave and return alive; and that beyond the
stream, under the crest of the mountain, there is an
image of pure gold seven cubits high. One enters the
cave at a little distance from the stream, and finds
first a grand chamber which is a veritable temple, with
arched dome, natural pulpit, and innumerable images
of Buddha, large and small. This place is regarded
as a most sacred shrine. Buddhist monks are always
there performing their devotions. The chamber is so
dark that they have to use tapers to see to read. The
dim light and the long-drawn tones of the worshippers
produce a very weird impression.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the temple-chamber narrow passages lead off
in different directions, till there is danger of losing
one’s way in the labyrinth. I followed Nān Inta and
his sons to the stream, which is reached at some
distance farther on. Being neither tall nor a swimmer,
I stopped and sauntered about in the various
rooms, waiting for my companions to verify or to disprove
the legend. Needless to say, both parts of it
were proved myths. My companions did return alive,
and no golden image was found. The cave is too
damp to make it safe for one to remain long in those
distant passages. Farther on the tapers burned but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>very dimly; and one would not choose to be left there
in pitch darkness. We could understand very well
how the legend arose of Yaks that devour those that
intrude into their dark caverns. There is no doubt
of the presence of a deadly gas much more to be
feared than the spirit of the great Lawa king, which
is believed to have taken up his abode there. We all
experienced more or less of the symptoms premonitory
of malarial attack, and before we got back to the
town Nān Inta was shaking with a genuine chill. A
heroic dose, however, of Warburg’s tincture with
quinine soon set him to rights. In this case, then, as
in many others, there is a foundation of truth at the
bottom of the legend.</p>

<p class='c009'>That night we had a great audience. It was generally
known that we intended to explore the cave, and
many, no doubt, came to see how we had fared. It
was well that Nān Inta had so far recovered from his
morning’s chill as to be ready to join in bearing testimony
not only to the falsity of the legend, but also
to the truth of the Gospel. It was a bright moonlight
night, and the people listened till very late, while we
sang hymns, preached the Gospel, and pointed them
to the better way. The result was seen years after
in the founding of a church there.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these provinces that we were now visiting, and
others more distant still, were originally settled by
refugees driven from the more southern districts by the
persecution for witchcraft. Now they are important
provinces. Since these people had been ruthlessly
driven forth because of the spirits, I thought they
would willingly accept any way of escape from their
control. But they seemed, if anything, more superstitious
and harder to reach than others. Having suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>once, as they supposed, from the malicious power
of the spirits, they seemed even more than others
to dread to incur their anger again by deserting them.
But there were many hopeful exceptions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Pāo was the next city visited. From the incidents
of our stay there I select the cases of two
persons who excited our deepest sympathy. One was
an aged Buddhist monk, a Ngīo, who, with a younger
companion, visited our tent daily. The monk was
a venerable man, with striking features, serene countenance,
earnest and intelligent. His long life had
been spent in worship, meditation, and study. All
this he soon told us with some quite natural pride.
While not bold, he was not reticent, freely stating his
own doctrines, hopes, and fears, and asking ours. To
the question what were his hopes for a future life, he
frankly said, “I don’t know. How can I? I have
tried to keep the commandments, have performed my
devotions, have counted my beads. But whether I
shall go up or down [indicating the directions with his
finger] I do not know. I have done what my books
tell me, but I have no light <i>here</i> [pointing to his heart].
Can the teacher’s religion give me any light?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The earnestness and the despondency of the man
drew me to him. I asked, what of his failures and
transgressions? “That,” he said, “is the dark point.
My books say that all my good deeds shall be rewarded,
but the failures and transgressions must be
punished before I can reach Nirvāna, the final
emancipation of the soul by the extinction of all desire.”
“How long will that be?” we ask. He answered
by giving a number that would baffle even
astronomers, who are accustomed to deal in almost
fabulous numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“But is not that virtually endless?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but what shall we do? That is what our
books say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is there no room for pardon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Buddha only points out the way that he followed
himself. He reached the goal by the same almost
endless journey. How shall we hope to do so
by any shorter or different route?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But supposing there is a way—that there is a great
sovereign of the universe, before all Buddhas and
higher than all Buddhas, who has the right and the
authority to grant full pardon through his own infinite
merit, and his vicarious assumption of all our
obligations and payment of all our debts. Would not
that be a joyful message?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; if true, it would be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so we argued till light seemed to gleam for once
into his mind. But the image of the dear old man
pointing up and then down with the sad confession, “I
know not whither I shall go,” is a vision that has saddened
me many a time since.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other case of special interest I state as it occurred,
with no attempt at explanation of the dream
involved in the story.—On the morning after our arrival,
Nān Inta and I started out to visit monasteries or
houses, wherever we might find listeners. I was
dressed in white clothes, and Nān Inta had on a white
jacket. We had made a number of calls, and were
about to pass by a house in which we saw only an
elderly woman and some children, presumably her
grandchildren. We were surprised to see her come
down from her house and run out after us, and
prostrating herself with the customary salutation given
to priests and princes, she begged us to stop and come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>in. We accepted her invitation, though surprised at
her evident demonstrations of joy. Sitting down on
the mat, we began to explain that we were teachers
of religion, pointing out the sure way of happiness
both in this life and in the life to come. Our message
was one from the great God and Creator to all
races and nations, inviting them to return from all
other refuges, and He would give them an inheritance
as His children in the life to come. She listened with
marked interest as we explained to her our religion,
and urged her to accept it. We were surprised at the
explanation she gave of her intense interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not long before our arrival she had a dream that
two men dressed in white came to her to teach her.
What they were to teach her she did not know; but
when she saw us walking up the street she said, “There
is the fulfilment of my dream!” She had watched us
as we entered other houses, fearful lest we should omit
hers. Now she was so glad we had come. It was at
least a strange coincidence, for she affirmed that the
dream was before she had ever heard of us. Whatever
may have been the cause, it was a delight to instruct
one who seemed to receive all that we said as a direct
message to her. This at once attracted Nān Inta to
her, and she listened to him with frequent exclamations
of delight, while he, in his earnest manner, explained
the Gospel message of pardon and life eternal
through Him who liveth and was dead, and behold He
is alive for evermore. She said her one great desire
had been to escape from the punishment of her sins;
but she never before had known that there was any
other way but to suffer for them herself. She, too,
was a Ngīo. We visited her frequently during the
week of our stay in Mûang Pāo, and to the last she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>interpreted our coming as the fulfilment of her dream.
This was the last that we knew either of her or of the
aged monk. Before we visited the place again she was
dead, and he had moved away.</p>

<p class='c009'>In those days when the people were afraid to make
a public profession of Christianity, it would have been
a great gain to the mission if we could have had
schools, and used them as a means of evangelizing the
youth. A first attempt, indeed, had been made by Mr.
Wilson with a few Burmese boys. A young Burmese
who had been trained in Maulmein, and who spoke
English, was employed to teach them under Mr. Wilson’s
oversight, in the hope that Lāo boys would presently
join them. This hope was not realized, and the
experiment was presently abandoned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first call for a Christian school was for the
education of girls. In the first Christian families girls
predominated. Mrs. McGilvary collected six or eight
Christian girls, and devoted as much time to them
as her strength and her family duties would permit.
They were really private pupils, living on our premises
and in our family. More wished to come than she
could do justice to. Hence about this time an appeal
was made for two single ladies to devote their whole
time to the school. But it was not till four years
later that Miss Edna E. Cole and Miss Mary Campbell
of the Oxford Female Seminary, Ohio, reached
Chiengmai. Very soon they had twenty pupils. From
this small beginning has grown our large Girls’ School.
Two of Mrs. McGilvary’s pupils were soon made assistants.
These and others of the first group became
fine women, who have left their mark on the church
and the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding our disappointment in the delay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of the school for boys, it proved a wise arrangement
that the Girls’ School was started first. A mission
church is sure to be greatly handicapped whose young
men must either remain single—which they will not do—or
be compelled to take ignorant non-Christian wives.
Such are a dead-weight to the husband, and the children
almost surely follow the mother. After marriage,
the almost universal custom of the country has
been that the husband lives with the wife’s family.
He becomes identified with it, and for the time a subordinate
member of it, almost to the extent of becoming
weaned from his own family. Where all the atmosphere
of the family is strongly Buddhist, with
daily offerings to the spirits and gala days at the temple,
the current would be too strong for a father, with
his secondary place in the family, to withstand. For a
while it was feared that Christian girls would have
difficulty in finding husbands. But, on the contrary,
our educated girls become not only more intelligent,
but more attractive in manners, dress, and character;
and, therefore, have been much sought after. The
homes become Christian homes, and the children are
reared in a Christian atmosphere. The result is that,
instead of the wife’s dragging the husband down, she
generally raises the husband up; and, as a general
rule, the children early become Christians.</p>

<p class='c009'>In August, 1876, our beloved Princess became very
seriously ill. Dr. Cheek had been called upon to
treat domestics in the family, but not the Prince or
Princess. Hearing that she was in a critical condition
under native doctors, and fearing the worst, I
took the liberty of suggesting that they consult Dr.
Cheek. They seemed pleased with the suggestion, and
asked me to accompany him—which I did for one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>two visits. His treatment was very successful, and
soon she was convalescent.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this same time we had an adventure with
white ants which came near costing us our much-valued
cabinet organ. It will serve to illustrate an
experience formerly common enough, and still not unknown.
One Wednesday evening before prayer-meeting
Mrs. McGilvary sat down at the instrument to look
over the tunes, when she found it full of white ants.
Our house was built on higher ground, into which the
creatures are driven when the lower grounds are filled
with water from the annual floods. They do not attack
the teak walls and floors of our houses, but,
climbing up the posts, at last they stumbled upon the
soft wood and leather inside the organ, and were just
beginning their feast when our meeting broke in upon
them. Had we not discovered them then, the instrument
would have been completely wrecked before
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once the white ants destroyed a trunkful of our
children’s clothes, once a box of “knock-down” chairs,
and once they attacked my library—evidently not at
all deterred by the learned discussions and deep
thought of Dr. Joseph A. Alexander’s <i>Commentary on
Isaiah</i>. They had got through the margin, and would
soon have digested the rest, had not an unexpected
occasion for opening the library saved it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c010'>XVI<br /> <br />SEEKERS AFTER GOD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>On New Year’s Day, 1877, I went into the city to
make some calls. The first was at the new
palace. In the large reception hall I found
the Princess, virtually alone. She was embroidering
some fancy pillow-ends for the priests—a work in
which she was an expert. Her maidens, some distance
off, were sewing priests’ robes. The Prince was in his
little workshop not far off, turning ivory rounds for
the railing of an elephant howdah, a favourite amusement
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The subject of religion was one that continually came
up in all my interviews with the Princess; but hitherto
she had apparently argued more for victory than from
a desire to reach the truth. She was as keen as a
lawyer to seize a point, and her quick wit made her a
very enjoyable antagonist. Not only she and her
domestics, but the whole country as well, had been
preparing for a great occasion of merit-making in connection
with the approaching dedication of a shrine.
Whether the peculiar interest of this conversation was
due to the fact that these matters had been running
in her mind, or to some particular mood in which I
found her, I never knew. Most likely it was both. A
chance allusion to the great event which was in every
one’s mouth, at once brought up the question. Stopping
her work and resting her arms on the embroidery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>frame, she asked, “Why is it that foreigners do not
worship the Buddha or his images, and do not believe
that merit is made thereby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She seemed to approach the question as a personal
one for herself. If we were right and she were wrong,
she would like to know it. We agreed on that point,
and I encouraged her in her estimate of its paramount
importance to every rational man or woman. If
Buddhism does, indeed, lead to happiness in a future
life, she was wise in diligently following its precepts;
but if wrong, it would be a fatal mistake. Why do we
not worship Buddha? Because he was only a man.
We reverence his character, as we do that of other
upright men who have tried to do good and to lead
their fellow-men to better things. Gautama Buddha
seems to have sought with all his soul for light—was
willing to forsake a kingdom and to renounce all
sensual and even intellectual pleasures in this life for
the hope of escaping sin and its consequences in the
next.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why do we worship Jehovah-Jesus? Because He is
our sovereign Lord. The Buddha groaned under his
own load of guilt, and was oppressed by the sad and
universal consequences of sin among men. The Christ
challenged His enemies to convince Him of sin, and His
enemies to this day have confessed that they find no
sin in Him. Buddhists believe that Buddha reached
Nirvāna after having himself passed through every
form of being in the universe—having been in turn
every animal in the seas, on the earth, and in the air.
He did this by an inexorable law that he and every
other being is subject to, and cannot evade. Our Jehovah-Jesus,
as our Scriptures teach, is the only self-existent
being in the universe, and Himself the cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of all other beings. An infinite Spirit and invisible, He
manifested Himself to the world by descending from
heaven, becoming man, taking on our nature in unison
with His own holy nature, but with no taint of sin.
He did this out of infinite love and pity for our race
after it had sinned. He saw there was no other able
to save, and He became our Saviour.</p>

<p class='c009'>And take the teachings of the two systems—which
is the more credible? The sacred books of the Princess
teach that there is no Creator. Everything, as the
Siamese say, “pen ēng”—comes to be of itself. All
this complicated universe became what it is by a fortuitous
concurrence of atoms, which atoms themselves
had no creator. We come as honest seekers for truth.
We look around, above, beneath. Everything seems to
imply the contrivance of mind. The sun rises and sets
with greater regularity than our clocks strike the hour
of noon. The seasons follow each other with wonderful
uniformity. Animals are born and die, plants and
trees grow and decay, each after its kind, and in wonderful
adjustment to the conditions about them. The
eye is made for seeing, the ear for hearing, and the
air for breathing. Light is necessary for work by day,
and darkness for sleep by night. This city has its walls
and gates; this palace has its beams, its roof, its doors
and windows, and its different apartments, because it
was so planned. The Princess gives her orders, and
her servants in distant villages come at her summons.
The Prince’s command is obeyed throughout all his
dominions. Subjects obey because they are under constituted
authority. Even so we obey Jehovah and not
Buddha, because we believe that He is the Creator and
the sovereign Lord of the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>In His word—His letter to our race—He claims
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to be Creator and Lord. We read His word, and
then we look around for evidence as to whether this is
really so. We find that evidence in earth and sea
and sky. A letter comes from the King of Siam. How
do we know that it is really his? It has his seal.
Not otherwise “the heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament showeth His handiwork.” By faith,
then, we believe that the worlds were made, as His word
tells us. We read the account of that creation. What
wonderful beings we are!—made in His image, endowed
in our degrees with His own attributes, and with
authority over the world in which He has placed us.
He has given us dominion over all the beasts of the
earth, the fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea.
Every time that a Buddhist kills a fish or a fowl, he
sins, because he breaks a command of his religion.
Why not so for a Christian? Because these creatures
were made for man’s use, and were given to him. We
partake with gratitude of the gifts our Father has provided
for us. This one great truth, when received by
Christians, relieves the conscience of one of the greatest
burdens that the followers of Buddha must bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if God made man in His image, why all this
suffering that we see and feel? The best explanation
ever given is that given in the Bible. Man was created
holy, and was put on trial. He transgressed. A subject
who disobeys the law of his sovereign incurs his
displeasure. He suffers for it. We are suffering from
this disobedience of our first parents by a law that we
daily see exemplified. A man by extravagance or vice
squanders his estate. His children are born penniless.
The Prince of Wieng Chan rebelled against the King
of Siam. His country was conquered and laid waste,
and thousands of its inhabitants were made captive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and deported. Thousands of the descendants of these
captives are now serfs. Why are they so? Because
of the errors or misfortunes of their ancestors. The
Prince appoints a governor over a province, with the
promise that if he is faithful, his children shall succeed
him. Because of misdemeanor he is deposed.
His descendants are born subjects and not rulers. We
belong to a fallen race.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somana Gautama belonged to the same race. He
groaned under its pains and penalties. He saw a race
sunk in misery. He saw its religion shamefully corrupt.
He inaugurated one of purer morality. But he
does not profess to be divine or a saviour. His religion
does not offer a sufficient remedy. By asceticism and
self-mortification it would extinguish all noble desire as
well as the vicious instincts with which we are born.
And then, after interminable cycles of transmigrations,
we may hope to reach a state of unconscious sleep.
Happiness and misery are inseparable things. We
escape the one only by escaping the other. That is the
dark prospect which makes Buddhism so pessimistic.
To this the Princess assented, “That is so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now compare this with the religion of Jesus. The
sovereign Father who loves His wandering, sinful children,
in His infinite wisdom devised a plan that satisfies
their needs and desires, “God so loved the world
that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.” Our Maker became our Redeemer by emptying
Himself of His glory and becoming man. He is Himself
the greatest possible illustration of the love of God to
the race. He came to reveal the Father. His holy life
we have in His word. He set us the only perfect example,
full of pity toward the miserable and the sinful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Then, by a painful and shameful death, He became
Himself a sacrifice for the sins of the world. He
obeyed the law which we had broken, and which condemns
us; and suffered in our stead the penalty due
to us. He conquered death. He took away the sting of
death by taking away sin. He arose from the dead,
showing Himself for many days. He ascended to
heaven before the eyes of His disciples. He has sent
His servants and His word to offer a full and free
pardon to all who will accept. He is now, and ever
will be, our intercessor in heaven. He sends His Spirit
to purify and fit us for an endless state of conscious
existence which begins at death, and not cycles after.
Millions of the best men and women the world has
ever seen have given their testimony to the reality of
this salvation by a triumphant death, with the assurance
that all sin and all suffering were past. Jesus
removed the curse, and brought to light the immortality
which we had forfeited by sin. The missionary and his
associates have left both parents and children that
they might offer this to the Princess and to her
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>To all of this the Princess was mainly a most interested
listener. She had asked to be taught. She
put no captious questions. I have omitted an occasional
assent that she gave, and an occasional difficulty
or doubt—not all of which could be fully answered; as,
for example, why an all-powerful God allowed the entrance
of sin, and now allows wicked spirits to tempt
us; or that other sad question, why the Gospel had not
been sent to them, so that they might have known this
from childhood—a question the burden of which should
press on my readers as well as on the missionary.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, after a long pause, the Princess made a wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>confession, the very words of which I can never
forget:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tā chak wā dūi kwām ching, kā han wā paw krū
ko tūk lêo.” To speak the truth, I see that the father-teacher
is right. “Kā chûa wā kong chak mī Pra Chao
ton dai sāng lōk.” I believe there surely must be some
divine Lord who made the world. “Lê bat nī ko chûa
tī paw krū atibāi dūi kān pon tōt dōi Pra Yēsū.” And
now I believe what the father-teacher has explained
about escape from punishment through the Lord Jesus.
And then, sadly—almost despairingly—she added, “Tê
chak yīa cha dai?” But what shall I do?—I fear it
will not be well to forsake “hīt paw hoi mê”—the customs
of my father, the foot-prints of my mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were sitting in the new brick palace—the first
ever built in the country. In the hall was a large
pier-glass with numerous other foreign articles, most
of them bought in Bangkok, and brought up for offerings
at the coming dedication of the shrine. I asked,
“Princess, did your father or grandfather have a brick
palace like this?” Somewhat surprised at the question,
she replied, “No.” “And I see the Princess
riding down to the landing every day in a foreign carriage.
Did your ancestors do that?” Before I could
make the application, she blushed, perceiving that she
was caught. I went on: “You do daily forsake old
customs, and adopt new ones which your ancestors
never knew. The whole method of government is
changing. This foreign cloth, which your maidens are
sewing for priests’ robes, was all unknown to your
forefathers. These things all come from lands where
the people worship neither the Buddha nor the spirits.
These are only some of the fruits that grow on the tree.
Better still, plant the tree; for all good fruit grows on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>it.” Just then our long conversation was interrupted
by the entrance of the Prince, who had worked till
he was tired. He asked what she and the teacher were
talking about so long. She replied that we were discussing
“bun lê bāp”—merit and sin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question often came up after this. She was in a
position where it was, humanly speaking, almost impossible
for her outwardly to forsake the customs of
the country. But I have reason to know that on that
morning she received truths which she never forgot.
We have seen before that neither she nor her husband
approved of her father’s act in murdering the Christians.
She continued a warm friend to the last, and
so did the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my way home that same forenoon I had another
interesting talk with our dear old friend, the abbot of
the Ūmōng monastery, who had been so true to us during
our troubles. On the gate-posts, as I entered, were
offerings of fruit, rice, betel, etc., to propitiate the
spirits. This is in flat violation of one of the fundamental
precepts of Buddhism, which declares that any
one who makes offerings to spirits is outside of the pale,
or, as we should say, is virtually excommunicate. Of
course, my abbot friend exculpated himself from all
complicity in the offerings. He himself neither worshipped
nor feared the spirits. But his disciples and
parishioners did, and he could not withstand them.
He, too, never gave up the form of Buddhism, but he
claimed that he worshipped Jesus daily as the great
Creator and Benefactor of our race. His merit he believed
to be infinitely greater than that of Buddha,
whom he knew to be a man. The abbot was a man
of broad mind, and a true and faithful friend. It is
well that it is not for us to say how much of error
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>is consistent with true discipleship, even in Christian
lands. I know that his deep-rooted friendship for us
was because we were teachers of a religion that offered
hopes which Buddhism does not give. I have in mind
many others, also, who believed our doctrine, though
they were never enrolled in our church; and not a few
that would urge others of their family and friends to
take, as Christians, the open stand which, from various
causes, they themselves were prevented from taking.
But the Lord knoweth them that are His.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great event of the year 1877 was the dedication
of a Buddhist shrine recently rebuilt on Doi Sutēp, the
noble mountain which is the pride and glory of
Chiengmai. From the level of the plain, and at a
distance of but four miles westward from the city, the
mountain rises in a single sweep four thousand five hundred
feet, forest-crowned to its very summit, seamed
with rushing brooks, and embroidered with gleaming
waterfalls. In the rainy season the play of cloud and
vapor, of sunshine and storm about its mighty mass,
forms an ever-changing picture of surpassing beauty
and grandeur. The Siamese and the Lāo are very fond
of an imposing setting and a commanding view for
their temples and shrines—on bold promontories by
sea or river, on high knolls and summits. The one on
Doi Sutēp crowns a projecting shoulder or bastion of
the mountain, some half-way up, and visible from all
parts of the Chiengmai plain. Each reigning Prince
has been desirous of doing something to beautify and
enrich this shrine. To rebuild it was, therefore, an
attractive idea to Prince Intanon at the beginning of
his rule.</p>

<p>AN ABBOT PREACHING</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>To do honour to the occasion, and to make merit
thereby, all the northern states, as far east as Lūang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Prabāng, sent their highest officials with costly offerings;
and the government of Siam sent a special representative.
For weeks and months previously the
whole country had been placed under requisition to
make preparations. Offerings were levied from every
town, village, and monastery, and, I believe, from every
household. Each guest of honour had a temporary
house built for him at the foot of the mountain, with
smaller shelters for persons of less rank. Nearly all
the princes and nobles of Chiengmai joined the encampment
at the base of the mountain, and thither,
also, was the city market removed, so that our housekeepers
had to send four miles to market!</p>

<p class='c009'>I had intended to pitch a tent near the encampment,
so as to be near the people for missionary work.
But a rheumatic attack during the opening days of the
festival prevented. Still, we had as many visitors at
home as we could attend to, and under conditions more
favourable for missionary work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such occasions are very attractive to the Lāo people.
For the time being the prohibition against
gambling is removed, and they make the most of it.
It may seem a queer way of making merit, but the
theory is that their merit earns them the right to a
good time for once. Thousands of rupees change
hands on such occasions. The mornings are given to
making offerings, the afternoons to boxing and games,
and the nights to theatricals and gambling. I was
glad that I was prevented from pitching my tent in
the midst of the noise and revelry. All those interested
in religion were the more free to call and converse
with us apart from the princes and the rabble.
Officers and monks from a distance were always especially
welcomed, and few of them in those days returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to their homes without calling on the foreign
teacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not get off on a long tour that season, being
unable to secure an elephant. It was better so, however,
for early in May Dr. Cheek went to Bangkok to
consult a physician, and went on thence as far as
Hongkong. It was April 30th of the next year before
he got back to Chiengmai. And the season proved to
be one of the most unhealthy in the history of the
mission. Worst of all, we had only six bottles of
quinine to begin the season with. There was a rush
for the quinine, and it seemed cruel to withhold it so
long as any was left. The fever was of a violent
type, and often fatal. Native doctors were helpless before
the scourge. On looking about me for a substitute
for quinine, I found that arsenic was the next
best remedy, and that Fowler’s Solution was the best
form for administering it. But we had not a drop of
the solution. We had, however, a bottle of arsenious
acid, and a United States Dispensatory, so that I had
to become pharmacist as well as doctor. I had all the
ingredients save one, an unessential colouring matter.
So I made it up by the quart. But it was not a medicine
to be trusted in native hands. They were accustomed
to take their own medicine by the potful, and
had the theory that if a little is good, a great deal
would be better.</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c010'>XVII<br /> <br />THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>In this same year, 1877, there occurred an event of
utmost importance to the mission and to the
whole country. We have seen that, up to the
death of Prince Kāwilōrot, those Lāo  provinces which
are now a part of Siam had been virtually free states.
The Siamese yoke had been very easy. They had never
been conquered in war. Their original association
with Siam had been a voluntary one, in order to
escape the oppressive rule of Burma. Their location
and their weakness made it a necessity that they should
look to one of these rival kingdoms for protection
against the other. At the same time, they added both
dignity and strength to the one on which they leaned—they
served it as a buffer against the other. Nature
had connected the Lāo  country more intimately with
Siam. All its communication with the sea was
through the Mênam Chao Prayā and its tributaries,
while a range of lofty mountains separated it from
Burma. In race and language too, they were Siamese,
and not Burmese.</p>

<p class='c009'>The relation had been mutually beneficial. Both
parties recognized the advantages of the arrangement,
and were satisfied. The balance of real advantage had
been to the weaker states. Their chiefs, indeed, were
required to make triennial visits to the Siamese capital,
to present there a nominal tribute, and to renew
their oath of allegiance. But with this exception they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>were virtually free. In his own country the Prince
had absolute rule. The Siamese had never interfered
with, or assumed control of, the internal affairs of the
North Lāo  states. It will be remembered that the
sanction of the Siamese government to the establishment
of the mission was given only after the Lāo
Prince had given his.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was probably an inevitable result that the stronger
power should in time absorb the weaker. And the
course of events had been tending that way. The forests
of teak on the upper branches of the Mênam were
too valuable to be concealed or to remain profitless.
The world needed the timber, and was willing to pay
for it. The country needed its value in money. The
Burmese of Maulmein, who were British subjects, had
skill in working out the timber, which the Lāo  had
not. With money and valuable presents they tempted
the Lāo  rulers, who formerly had absolute authority
over the forests, to grant them concessions to cut the
timber and market it in Bangkok. Both parties were
avaricious, and both were probably crooked. Larger
bribes sometimes induced a Lāo  ruler to issue a second
concession to work a forest already assigned to
an earlier applicant. The result was a constant succession
of lawsuits brought by British subjects against
the Lāo. Since the Lāo  states were dependencies of
Siam, the Siamese government was often called upon
to enforce judgment against them; while the Lāo  felt
that the Siamese suzerainty ought to shield them from
such attack. Siam was now come to be in fact the
buffer between the Lāo  and the outside world. Instead
of the pleasant relations which had hitherto existed
between the two peoples, there was now constant
friction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Up to the time when Prince Kāwilōrot gave his public
and official promise before the United States Consul
and the representative of the Siamese government, in
the little sālā at the landing-stage of Wat Chêng in
Bangkok, no foreign power other than the English had
had any claim on the Lāo or any contact with them.
It was only the impolitic act of killing the Christians
which brought the Lāo Prince into conflict with the
representative of the United States government. The
fact that it was the missionaries who were immediately
concerned had nothing to do with the question. Had
the agreement been made with American citizens in
any other capacity or business, the obligation would
have been the same. The Siamese government recognized
the obligation, and, as we have seen, guaranteed
the continuance of the mission. And that guarantee
was an additional reason for having an official representative
of Siam resident in Chiengmai.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had the new Prince been as strong as he was mild
and good, and had the Chao Uparāt been like him, it
is possible that the old feudal relation might have continued
another generation or two. No doubt the
Siamese government thoroughly trusted the loyalty
of the new Prince; but it did not regard him as a man
sufficiently strong to hold the reins of power at that
juncture. Moreover, all the business of ruling was
largely given over to the Uparāt; and he in a number
of ways had shown his opposition to our work and his
jealousy of the English and of foreigners generally.
When news reached us first that a High Commissioner
was appointed, and then that he was on the way, there
was great anxiety to know what stand he would take
with reference to Christianity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prayā Tēp Worachun proved to be an admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>selection for Commissioner. He had many of the qualities
of a statesman. He was cool, calm, patient, and
wise. Judging from the result, it is evident that his
instructions were: to be conservative; to make no rash
or premature move; and to uphold the royal authority
conjointly with the old princely rule—peaceably, if
possible, but firmly—till Siam could assume complete
control. Meanwhile he was to follow the English plan
of governing through the native rulers. He was willing
to bide his time. Every new assumption of power
on the part of Siam was reluctantly yielded by the Lāo.
But everything conspired to favour the policy of Siam.
The Lāo Prince was passive and unambitious. For
the Uparāt no one felt the reverence or the fear that
all had felt for the late Prince Kāwilōrot. The Commissioner’s
fairness and business integrity enabled
him to maintain himself perfectly in his difficult position
between the two branches of the Tai race, and
amid the conflicting interests of the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>In religion the new Commissioner was a stoic. His
boast was that he needed no other religion than to
be loyal to his king, and upright and just in his dealings
with men. Virtue was its own reward, and vice
was its own punishment. He accepted Gibbon’s conclusion
that all religions are alike good for the state,
alike true for their adherents, and alike false for the
philosopher. He encouraged Christianity because it
taught a good morality and made good citizens. But
he could see neither the possibility nor the necessity of
an atonement for sin. On one point I should say we
were in full accord. In his opposition to the spirit-worship
of the Lāo he was almost rabid. He sympathized
deeply with the poor people accused of witchcraft,
who were driven out of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>During the absence of Dr. Cheek and Mr. Wilson
with their families, I should have been utterly unable
to cope with the situation, had it not been for my wife’s
clear business talent and tact in planning. The little
girls, too, had begun to show somewhat of their
mother’s aptitude for work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the fever scourge continued to spread and
increase in violence. The progress of the disease was
so rapid that often the person attacked would never
rally at all. An interesting example of the way in
which healing of the body sometimes opened the way
to the healing of the soul, is seen in the case of Sên
Kam, an officer who was in charge of all the irrigation
works on the Doi Saket plain, and who one day was
brought to my gate, as it was supposed, to die. The
new medicine quickly checked his fever, and presently
he began to study in Siamese the Shorter Catechism,
Genesis, and the Gospel of John. In due time he
returned home a believer. But his desertion from
Buddhism caused such opposition in his province that
his baptism was delayed. His family were so shaken
that some of them wished to return to the old worship.
But one young granddaughter of twelve or thirteen
years had begun to read our books and to attend our
services. She refused to return to the monastery, and
would run away from it to the chapel. She persevered
until she brought back the whole family into
the Christian fold.</p>

<p class='c009'>In further illustration of the crowded experiences
of this time, I may cite the following items from letters
to our children, written during the latter half of
the year 1877.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Last week the King sent for your father to treat a
prince who had had the fever for fifteen days. During his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>paroxysms his cries could be heard throughout the whole
neighbourhood. In their extremity they sent for your
father, and gave up the case to him with permission to
remove all spirit-charms during the treatment. He is now
out of danger.” [<span class='sc'>Mrs. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c024'>“For three weeks I have had a young prince in hospital
who had attempted suicide by cutting his throat. He was a
fearful sight. It did not seem possible that he could survive
the night. I sewed up the wound, however, and now he is
well, and apparently penitent.” [<span class='sc'>D. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c024'>“We are well as usual, but engrossed in work. Your
father is pressed beyond measure with the work of two men.
On the return of Dr. Cheek’s boats, we received forty
ounces of quinine; but it is going at a fearful rate. The
hospital is full of patients, and there are at least one
hundred more to be prescribed for daily. If I did not drop
everything else and help him, he could not possibly get
through the day’s work.” [<span class='sc'>Mrs. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c024'>“Soon the quinine was all gone, and our compound was
becoming a veritable lazaretto. Most of the patients were
anæmic and dropsical from long-standing fever. They
came, because to remain at home was to die. Then a new
complication arose. Unusual symptoms began to occur that
I could not account for. One morning at breakfast we
were called to see a little girl who had a hemorrhage. She
had no cough and had no consumption. While I was looking
up the symptoms and cause, your mother discovered
that the bleeding was from the gums. That gave us the
clue. It was scurvy. I found that we had at least thirty
others whose gums were similarly diseased. We began at
once to give them lime-juice, and prescribed vegetables, for
the lack of which they were starving. It is the invariable
custom of Lāo doctors in cases of fever to put the patient on
a strict diet of boiled rice and dried fish. On such diet
some of our patients had been living for two or three months.
They might as well have been on an arctic voyage!”
[<span class='sc'>D. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Day before yesterday we tried to have a picnic. A
princess had promised us two elephants, but only one came.
Your father took a horse. The three children and I rode
the elephant. Our destination was the Doi Sutēp temple.
About half the way up the mountain the elephant either concluded
that there was no fun in going up alone, or, more
probably, that he had an uncomfortable load, and refused
to go any further. He turned out of the road, and tried
to throw the driver from his neck. The children became
alarmed, and we dismounted as best we could. The children
refused to try riding him again; and since we had
come largely for their pleasure, we had our lunch by a
brook, and returned home on foot.” [<span class='sc'>Mrs. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c024'>“We had an interesting incident at our December communion.
Just as I had announced the communion hymn,
I saw Chao Borirak—the Nān prince, who had twice accompanied
me with his elephant on my journeys, and for
whose sake largely one of my trips to Nān had been taken—enter
the room. As he had been the subject of much
special prayer on our part, I could hardly command my
voice sufficiently to proceed with the hymn. On my return
from my furlough he had written that he would visit me at
the first opportunity. His uncle, the Prince of Nān, had
a grandson in danger of losing his sight from an accident.
He had persuaded the Prince that possibly our medicine
might help him. He brought a few presents from the
Prince, and for himself had brought a gold ring with a
native pearl from the Nān river. He is very anxious that I
should move to Nān, but I tell him that he must wait for
you.... With fever and death around us we have been
wonderfully preserved from ‘the pestilence that walketh in
darkness, and the destruction that wasteth at noonday.’
We have had our anxieties about the children. During the
last hot season we were afraid that little Margaret would
melt away, she was so thin.” [<span class='sc'>D. McG.</span>]</p>

<p class='c025'>But the labours of the year were not in vain. During
its progress Nān Suwan, who afterwards became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the founder of the church in Chieng Sên, and four
others who became influential ruling elders, were baptized.
And with these was Pā Kawng, an aged slave
of the Prince, who lived to be one of the Lāo saints.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c010'>XVIII<br /> <br />WITCHCRAFT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>On January 6th, 1878, two native converts were
received into the church—Nān Sī Wichai, the
fine scholar who had been Dr. Cheek’s teacher,
and the wife of a leading elder—and with them our
own daughter Cornelia. This was the bright beginning
of the year that brought in religious toleration.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day in March, as I was sitting in my study, I
was surprised to see a tall man, a stranger, with the
bearing of an officer, enter. He pointed with both
fingers to his ears, and asked if the teacher could say
“Ephphatha,” and open the ears of a deaf man as
Jesus did. It was a strange introduction—to be accosted
by a Lāo with a quotation from Scripture in
the ancient Aramæan tongue! I judged by his accent
that he was from Lakawn. In answer to my enquiry
as to who he was, I learned that he was a Prayā, the
highest rank among Lāo officials; that he had formerly
been first in the Lakawn court, but was not then in
office. But where had he received a Bible, and who
had taught him?</p>

<p class='c009'>I learned that some twenty years before this he had
accompanied his Prince to Bangkok, and there had met
Dr. Bradley, from whom he received a copy of the Old
Testament History in Siamese, and the New Testament
so far as it was then published. He had learned
Siamese in order to be able to read and understand the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>contents of these books. He often wished that he had
lived in the time of Christ. But, having no one to
guide him, he had not learned to draw the lessons that
the Bible story was designed to teach.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had come to Chiengmai to get the assistance of
the princes there in righting an unjust decision of
the Lakawn court against him. He had heard, too,
that there were teachers of a new religion; and he
wished to know whether we taught as did Dr. Bradley
and the books received from him. His position, his
manners, his whole history, including his connection
with my father-in-law, attracted me to him with uncommon
force. Our first interview was long and very
satisfactory. His questions were such as he had long
wished to put to some one who could explain them.
The truth had been securely lodged in his mind. It
was most interesting to see how a single new thought
would illuminate it all.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what he had sown he was then reaping. While
in power he doubtless had oppressed others. Once he
had received “hush money” from murderers whom he
should have prosecuted. If he had not taken it, he
said they would have murdered him, too. His sins
weighed upon his conscience. His most anxious question
was whether Jesus could really save <i>all</i> men from
<i>all</i> sins. When asked if Buddha could do so, he
said that he never had seen any such promise in any
of the scriptures. He would search again. He went
to an abbot friend from whom he borrowed, as he said,
“books by the armful.” He looked them over with
this one question in view: Is there hope of pardon offered
to sinners? He went a second time for more.
At his third coming the abbot, finding out what he was
after, refused to lend to him further. But he confessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>that his search was in vain. He argued with
the monks, refuted them; and they cast him off. Upon
his arrival the Chao Uparāt had promised his assistance
in the lawsuit. When, however, he found that
the Prayā was becoming a Christian, he dropped him.
But he had found an intercessor greater than any
earthly prince. For Him he was willing to face all
opposition and to bear all reproach.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was baptized on the 8th of May, just before returning
home. The rains had already set in, and were
likely greatly to impede his journey. Yet he reached
Lakawn without encountering a shower. His account
of it afterwards was, that whenever he saw the clouds
threatening, he would wave his hands and pray that
they might be dispersed. Lāo Christians have not become
befogged with doubts as to the efficacy of prayer
for temporal blessings. After his return to his home,
his family all became believers, and others also whom
he taught. At his invitation I went over to instruct
them and to administer the sacraments. Two years
later the number was sufficient to warrant their organization
into a church, of which the Prayā was made
the first elder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cheek’s return at the end of April, 1878, took
from my shoulders the care of the medical work—a
very great burden. During his absence I had put up
a hospital building of six rooms. This since then has
been moved, and now forms the nucleus of the Chiengmai
Hospital. The doctor soon found himself overwhelmed
with practice. He was a fine surgeon and a
good doctor, and had great influence both with princes
and with people. Moreover, Mrs. Cheek’s inheritance
of the language—like my wife’s—was a great advantage
to them both. Only a few days after the doctor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>arrival we lost our valuable hospital assistant,
Lung In. One evening he complained of some trouble
about the heart. He talked a few moments with his
family, then said he felt better and would go to sleep—and
in an instant was gone.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In 1878 Chieng Sên, the old abandoned city which I
visited in 1872, became the theme of anxious consultation
on the part of the government. The Lāo had
taken away the inhabitants, but could not take away
the land. It had become a rendezvous for robbers
and lawless men from all quarters. The Western
Shans from Burma were settling upon it. Siam evidently
must repopulate the province, or lose it. It was
finally agreed that one thousand descendants of the
original captives should be drafted from Chiengmai,
one thousand from Lakawn, and five hundred from
Lampūn, and sent back to reoccupy the province. Chao
Noi Inta, the highest in rank of the available descendants
of the original captive princes, was commissioned
as governor. The special interest this exodus has for
our narrative lies in the fact that among these returned
captives was the family of Nān Suwan, one of
our best men, and already an elder of the church. At
first Nān Suwan thought of buying himself off, as
many did. But when it was pointed out to him that
his going would be the means of starting a church
there, he readily consented to go.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The governor was a warm friend of mine, and was
urgent that we establish a mission and a church there
before Buddhist temples could be built. The province
was virgin soil. A great mortality usually attends the
repeopling of deserted places and the clearing of the
land. The governor was very anxious that we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>send a physician. Had we gone then with five hundred
ounces of quinine, we should have had command
of the situation. As it was, Nān Suwan was furnished
with some quinine, which gave him the name of doctor.
Broad-minded, hospitable, kindly, and thoroughly upright,
there could have been no better selection. He
became the real father of the Chieng Sên church. His
family was a light in the city. His youngest daughter,
Kūi Kêo, one of Mrs. McGilvary’s first pupils, taught
most of the early Christians there to read the Scriptures
in Siamese. The elder himself became a great
favourite with the governor, who used to say that the
fact of his being governor, and, therefore, under authority,
alone prevented him from uniting with the church.
Another of the returning captives was Sên Yā Wichai,
the first believer in Chiengmai. He settled on the
western border of the Chieng Sên plain.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The Lāo as a race have been in bondage to the spirits.
We have already had frequent occasion to refer to the
slavish fear of them among all classes, from the highest
to the lowest. No event in life, from birth to the last
offices for the dead, could be undertaken without consulting
or appeasing the presiding spirits of the clan,
the household, or the country. Their anger is the fruitful
cause of every disease and calamity that flesh is
heir to.</p>

<p class='c009'>In many ways this would seem a less elevating and
ennobling cult than pure Buddhism. But really it
has a much closer affinity with Christianity than has
Buddhism, whether as scientifically held by the learned,
or as embraced by the common people. Buddhism is
too atheistic to bring it into comparison here with
Christianity. It lacks the essential attribute of religion—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span> sense of dependence on some higher power.
It belongs to a different order of thought. The spirit-cult,
on the other hand, does recognize invisible powers
whose goodwill or illwill brings prosperity or adversity.
From this to one Great Spirit, who is sovereign
over all, is but another step on the same line of
ascent. So their spirit-offerings come nearer the idea
of propitiation than do the offerings of Buddhism,
which in some quite unaccountable manner are supposed
to bring merit to the offerer.</p>

<p class='c009'>A belief in witchcraft—that is, in the temporary
or permanent residence of some evil spirit in men—has
been confined to no one age or race. Its predominance
among the northern Tai tribes is very remarkable
in view of its inconsistency with Buddhism, which
has long been the religion of the race. In the contest
for supremacy, the spirit-cult, while it has not superseded
Buddhism, has secured the stronger hold on
the people. They worship Buddha and make offerings
in his temples; but they fear and dread the power of
the spirits to inflict present evil. It is safer to neglect
Buddha than these. And the power of a malicious
spirit is most dreaded when it has taken up its abode
in a human habitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the time of our first arrival in Chiengmai we
were continually amazed to find what multitudes of
people had been driven from their homes for supposed
witchcraft. All the northern provinces and towns, as
has already been mentioned, were largely peopled by
that unfortunate class. Accusation of witchcraft had
become one of the most dreaded means of oppression
and persecution. It was a favourite way of getting
rid of an envied rival or of a disagreeable neighbour.
No family and no rank were safe from such attack.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Princes, even, had fallen under its ban. When once
the suspicion of witchcraft was well started, the individual
or the family was doomed. Our sympathies
had often been aroused in behalf of these unfortunates;
but no favourable opportunity had occurred for interference
in any other way than by our teaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, in August, 1878, the opportunity came. I
had a request from a prince of some wealth and standing,
that I would take under our protection Pā Sêng
Bun and her family, accused of witchcraft. The
woman was first the under-wife of the Prince’s deceased
father, who was a man of note in his day. She
had two fine boys by a subsequent husband, and a niece
nearly grown. This second husband was a widower,
whose former wife was suspected of dealing in the
occult art; and the theory was that the evil spirit
came into her family through these sons. In that
season of heavy rains and flooded streams, the whole
family was to be driven off—some of them surely to die
on the way. The patron said that he was helpless;
that no one in the land, unless it were ourselves, could
shield them from that fate. I told him that we were
perfectly willing to risk the anger of the spirits, only
we did not wish unnecessarily to offend the prejudices
of the people. He was willing to assume all <i>legal</i> responsibility;
for the rest, we might fight it out with
the spirits as we pleased. After notifying the Siamese
Commissioner of the situation, we brought the family
to our place.</p>

<p class='c009'>That very day their house was burned down; and
not a tree or bush was left standing on the premises
to furnish shelter to the spirits. But that did not stop
the clamour. There was then in their village a great
epidemic of fever. By common consent it was agreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>that this had been caused by the evil spirit resident in
the lads. With boyish curiosity they had twice or
thrice gone back to visit the site of their old home, and,
strange to say, after each visit a new case of sickness
had occurred, which was, of course, attributed to their
presence. It was vain to point out the utter ridiculousness
of the idea, or to show that no sickness had
occurred on our place since their arrival. That was
easily explained. The spirit was afraid of our God,
and did not dare to enter the premises. It took refuge
in a large tree outside till the boys came out again,
when it entered its former habitation and went with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally the patron prince sent word that we must
give that family up. He could endure the odium no
longer. When I refused, he threatened to take the
matter into court. To this I replied that I was perfectly
willing that the case be tried; but it should not
be tried before a Lāo court, but before the Commissioner.
If they could convince him that the sickness
in the village was caused by a malicious spirit resident
in that family, they should be sent off immediately.
But, I added, it would be fair to make one condition.
If the accusers failed, <i>they</i> should be driven
off. This—as I knew it would do—put an end to the
whole affair. We heard no more of it. It was a great
victory in the demon controversy; and, later, as we
shall see, it proved a boon to scores of helpless victims.
Before the arrival of the Commissioner such
an outcome would have been impossible. No Lāo
court would have refused to expel persons so accused.
The family of Pā Sêng Bun proved to be a treasure,
becoming one of the most influential and valuable in
the Chiengmai church.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c010'>XIX<br /> <br />THE EDICT OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Our narrative has now brought us to a point
where an apparently trivial circumstance became
the occasion of an event not only of utmost
importance to us and to our work, but of far-reaching
consequences to the country at large. Sometime
near the middle of this year, 1878, the eldest
daughter of Nān Inta was to be married to a Christian
young man studying for the ministry. Both parties
at that time were virtually members of our family.
The expected bride was a pupil of Mrs. McGilvary’s,
and the groom was a private pupil of mine. The immediate
family connections on both sides were Christians.
Inasmuch as this was the first Christian marriage
in the church, we had prepared to celebrate it
with a little wedding feast. Besides the Christians, a
few princes and a few special friends were invited, all
anxious to see a Christian marriage ceremony. Among
the invited guests was Chao Tēpawong, Nān Inta’s
liege-lord, and brother of the Uparāt.</p>

<p class='c009'>We learned that the family patriarch—known to be
a violent opposer of Christianity—had threatened to
prevent the marriage, unless we first paid to him, as
tribal head of the family, the spirit-fee originally designed
to furnish a feast for the spirits. It was a
small sum—among common people not more than six
rupees. That payment would legalize marriage without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>any further ceremony. In fact, the payment may
be regarded as a distinctively religious act, since it
recognizes the spirits as the guardians and protectors
of the family. When one becomes a Christian, that
allegiance is cast off. By an unwritten law or custom
of the country, that fee belonged to the patriarch,
and he decided to exact it or make trouble. I had
explained the marriage ceremony to the princes and to
the Commissioner. I knew that the latter recognized
the justice of our position, and I assumed that the
government would support us if the patriarch caused
any trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough, early in the morning the patriarch’s
loud voice was heard in our yard threatening dire punishment
to the family if his demand were not granted.
The bride’s father became alarmed, and thought we
must have some official backing, or he would surely
get into trouble. The guests had arrived, and every
one was on the <i>qui vive</i> to see which side was to win
in the contest. I went to the liege-lord of the family
for his sanction; but he said it was too big a question
for him to pass upon. I must go to a higher authority.
It had evidently become a question that could not be
settled that morning. Old Adam would have said,
“Marry them and trust to the justice of your cause.
Let the old patriarch whistle!” But we teach our
Christians to be obedient to the law, and we wished to
avoid unnecessary trouble. So there was nothing to
do but to swallow our mortification, apologize to our
guests, invite them to partake of the feast, and seek
legal sanction afterwards.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner that same day Dr. Cheek and I called
upon the Commissioner. We had failed, and were
come to him for advice. His sympathies were easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>enlisted, but he had no authority to interfere in local
or tribal matters. He advised us to go to the Prince.
We did so, meeting him and the Princess alone. Their
position was like that of the Commissioner. They,
too, sympathized with the young couple and with us.
But it raised a new question for them, and they feared
to give offence. The Princess said they had been
criticised by our enemies for standing by us; but if the
Chao Uparāt would give his sanction, no one else,
they thought, would dare oppose. So we went next to
the Uparāt; but there we ran against a stone wall. He
inwardly laughed at our predicament. He had us just
where he wanted us to be. If our young people could
not marry, our work would be virtually stopped. He
said that no one but the King of Siam had authority
to interfere in such a question.</p>

<p class='c009'>We returned home signally defeated. Next day I
went alone to the Chao Uparāt, and argued the justice
of our case. The parties had renounced their allegiance
to the spirits. It was clearly unreasonable to require
what we could not conscientiously submit to. I
even begged him to come to our aid, since both the
Commissioner and the Prince had said that they were
sure that no one else would oppose his decision. If
we were compelled, we must appeal to His Majesty the
King of Siam, though we should be very reluctant to
do so. Since marriage is a civil as well as a religious
rite, I was sure His Majesty would admit the justice
of our appeal. Either thinking that we would not
make the appeal, or that the appeal would be in vain,
he at last refused to discuss the question further.
Little did he know, nor did we then, that he was doing
the best possible thing for us.</p>

<p class='c009'>I returned then to the Commissioner to report. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>conflict which, as we have seen, was probably inevitable
between the royal authority represented by the Commissioner
on the one hand, and the local rulers on the
other, was becoming inevitable sooner than was anticipated.
The Commissioner just then was himself
having great trouble with officials who were restive
under his authority. The Lakawn Princes had a difficulty
among themselves, and had come to the Commissioner
to have the case adjudicated. His decision
had been unfavourable to one of the higher officials—probably
the chief himself. Whoever it was, he had
committed the unpardonable offence of departing to
Lakawn without taking leave of the Commissioner,
presumably intending to appeal to Bangkok. So that
morning I found His Excellency indignant at the insult
offered to him, and, through him, to his sovereign.
The royal authority which he represented was challenged.
Moreover, some of the acts of the Chao
Uparāt had offended him. His impressions were confirmed
and strengthened by the recital of our grievances.
He advised me to write these all out in full,
giving specifications that could be substantiated—and
such were rapidly multiplying. For, provoked at Nān
Inta and his family, and emboldened with his own success
in stopping the wedding, the Chao Uparāt had
summoned Nān Inta and had set him to watching his
summer-house on the river—the work of a menial, such
as Nān Inta had never yet been reduced to doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the moment had come when an appeal for
religious toleration might be made with fair prospect
of success. As the only way of avoiding continual
interference in the future, the Commissioner
himself advised that the appeal be made for religious
toleration in general, rather than for freedom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Christian marriage, which was only a single item.
The Commissioner was busily engaged in writing out a
report of his own grievances, to be sent to the King. He
said that he would mention our case also in his report,
and offered to forward my letter with his despatches.</p>

<p class='c009'>I immediately dropped everything else, and addressed
myself to writing that appeal unto Cæsar. In
it I referred to the sanction of the Siamese government
to the establishment of the mission, given after the
interview with Prince Kāwilōrot at Wat Chêng, and
subsequently renewed on the appointment of his successor,
Prince Intanon. I was very careful not only
to exonerate the latter from all blame, but also highly
to commend both him and his Princess for their uniform
kindness, and for their sympathy in this particular
emergency. But the act of the Chao Uparāt
was, no doubt, only the beginning of what he would do
if he were not restrained. It was evidently his intention
to reduce to slavery a family that had always
been free. In behalf of his loyal Christian subjects
we begged His Majesty to guarantee to them the same
privileges, civil and religious, which his other subjects
enjoyed, among which surely was the right to be married
according to the ceremony of their own religion.
One request I put in with some misgiving—that the
Christians might be exempted from compulsory work
on the Sabbath; otherwise that point might always be
used to create difficulty when the master was hostile.
While thus making our appeal to man, importunate
prayer was continually offered to Him who had been
our help in times past.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very necessary that the appeal should go as
the joint action of the mission as then constituted. I
was aware that Dr. Cheek, the only other member of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the mission then on the ground, did not enter heartily
into the appeal. He was fearful that it would only
make bad worse; that it would give offence to the Lāo
rulers, and possibly to the Siamese as well. But as regards
the Lāo, matters had already reached an extremity
in the case of the one who really ruled the country.
And as to the Siamese, our only human hope
was in the King. So, when my paper was finished, I
took it to Dr. Cheek, and read it over to him. He
listened very attentively to the reading, and at its
close I was delighted to hear him say, “That seems
all right.” After a few clerical alterations which he
suggested, we both signed the paper. A summary of
it was read to the Commissioner, and was afterwards
enclosed by him with his despatches. Our appeal
to the King of Siam had, of course, to be made through
the United States Consul, Colonel Sickels. Our letter
to the King was, therefore, sent unsealed under cover to
the Consul, so that he might read it; and with it went
a letter giving him a full account of all the particulars
of the case, and urging him to use his influence, both
personal and official, on our behalf. The whole was
entrusted to a special messenger in a swift boat, with
instructions to make all possible speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having done our best, we waited prayerfully and
hopefully. But the greatness of the issue involved
made us anxious. The liberal policy of the young
King was not then so well known as it became later.
One could not be absolutely certain how even our
Consul would regard it. We trusted, however, to the
friendship of the Foreign Minister, who had invited me
to Pechaburī, and who had always been our true
friend. No one of all these persons concerned disappointed
our expectations, or even our hopes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Colonel Sickels acted with commendable despatch.
He was favoured in securing an audience without the
usual formalities. At that time His Majesty had a regular
day each week when his subjects and others might
approach him informally in his summer garden with
petitions on urgent business. Our appeal was presented
to him there. He was already aware of its nature
through the Commissioner’s despatches. Anxiety
with regard to the political situation in the North no
doubt prompted him to a decisive assertion of authority
in this matter as well. His Majesty informed the
Consul that his government had already reached a
decision favourable to our request, and that full religious
toleration was to be proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The courier returned with unwonted speed, reaching
Chiengmai on Sunday, September 29th. Late in
the afternoon of that day the Commissioner notified
me of the arrival of despatches. Next morning I called
upon him. He was radiant with joy. All his own requests
had been granted, and enlarged powers had been
given him, including power to make proclamation of
religious toleration in all the Lāo states. He seemed
as much delighted with our success as with his own.
He said that he had already notified the princes and
officials to call in the afternoon, and he would then
inform them of the result. Of course, our hearts were
overflowing with gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the appointed hour the Prince, the Chao Uparāt,
and all the high officials were assembled. When the
order for the proclamation was made known, some of
them made a final personal appeal to him to stay proceedings.
They argued that unrestricted permission
to become Christians would be the ruin of the country.
To understand the force of this objection it must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>remembered that among the Lāo, breach of the Seventh
Commandment was punished, not by civil or
criminal procedure, but by a “spirit-fine” paid to the
patriarch of the woman’s family. It was argued that
if Christian young men should transgress with Lāo
girls or women, under the new régime, no fine could be
imposed, and there would be no redress whatever. The
Commissioner then sent a messenger, asking me to
come to the audience. The scene, as I entered, reminded
me of that other notable audience with Prince
Kāwilōrot and another Commissioner. The Commissioner
stated their objection, and asked me what I had
to say. I replied that the difficulty was purely an
imaginary one. In the first place, it was a cardinal
doctrine of the church to forbid such sins. In the
second place, if a professed Christian violated his vows,
he made himself amenable to the discipline of the
church, and so put himself beyond its protection. The
Commissioner said, “I have already so answered, but I
wanted those who are present to hear it from the
teacher himself.” To this no reply was made. After
a short pause the Commissioner broke the silence.
With a gesture to the audience, he said that the business
was ended. When he had leisure, the Edict
would be issued. One after another the assembled
princes and officials retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my way home I noticed that the Chao Uparāt had
stopped at his little sālā beside the river, the same
that Nān Inta had been set to watch. To show that
I had no personal grudge, I stopped to call on him.
Rising, he gave me a more respectful welcome than
usual, and ordered a foreign rug to be spread—the respectful
way of receiving guests before the day of
chairs. When I was seated he asked why I had made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>complaint against him to Bangkok—he was very sore
at heart about it. I replied that I was sorry, indeed,
to be obliged to do it. Did he not remember how I
had told him that we could not submit to his decision;
how I had even entreated him not to force us to appeal
to the King? And I could not appeal without
giving the facts as my ground for so doing. But now
I hoped that bygones might be bygones, and that we
might be friends.—The fact was that my letter had
been translated in Bangkok, sent back to Chiengmai,
and had been read at the audience before my arrival.
But I never before had such a reception from the
Uparāt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wording of the proclamation was left to the
Commissioner. If he had been hostile, or even indifferent,
its effect might easily have been neutralized
by a little vagueness or ambiguity. But he was
anxious to have the matter settled decisively. When
I took my leave of him that morning, he promised to
show me the draft of the proclamation before he should
affix his seal. When I saw it, there were only a few
verbal changes to suggest. It was a general permission
to the Lāo to adopt any religion they pleased. I
suggested that since it was specifically granted in the
interest of Christians, it was desirable that Christianity
be specifically named—which was done. At my
request two extra copies of the proclamation were
made with the official seals attached; one for deposit
in our safe, and one that might be read to the people.
The following is a literal translation of this famous
document:</p>

<p class='c024'>I Prayā Tēp Worachun, Representative of His Majesty
the Supreme King of Siam in Chiengmai, Lampūn, and
Lakawn, hereby make proclamation to the Princes, Rulers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and Officers of various grades, and to the common people
in the cities and provinces named:—That His Majesty the
King of Siam has been graciously pleased to send me a
Royal Letter under the Royal Seal, to the effect that D. B.
Sickels, Esqr., United States Consul, had communicated to
the Foreign Minister of Siam a complaint signed by Rev.
D. McGilvary and Dr. M. A. Cheek against certain parties
for molesting the Christians and compelling them to observe
their old religious customs. The Foreign Minister laid
the subject before His Majesty, who most graciously listened
to the said complaint, and gave the following Royal Command
in reference to the same:—</p>

<p class='c027'>That religious and civil duties do not come in conflict.
That whoever wishes to embrace any religion after seeing
that it is true and proper to be embraced, is allowed to do
so without any restriction. That the responsibility for a
right or a wrong choice rests on the individual making the
choice. That there is nothing in the laws and customs of
Siam, nor in its foreign treaties, to throw any restriction on
the religious worship and service of any one.</p>

<p class='c027'>To be more specific:—If any person or persons wish to
embrace the Christian Religion, they are freely permitted
to follow their own choice.</p>

<p class='c027'>This Proclamation is to certify that from this time
forth all persons are permitted to follow the dictates of their
own conscience in all matters of religious belief and practice.</p>

<p class='c027'>It is moreover strictly enjoined on Princes and Rulers,
and on relatives and friends of those who wish to become
Christians, that they throw no obstacles in their way, and
that no one enforce any creed or work which their religion
forbids them to hold or to do—such as the worship and
feasting of demons, and working on the Sabbath day, except
in the case of war and other great unavoidable works, which,
however, must not be a mere pretence, but really important.
Be it further observed that they are to have free and unobstructed
observance of the Sabbath day. And no obstacle is
to be thrown in the way of American citizens employing such
persons as they may need, since such would be a breach of the
treaty between the two countries.</p>

<p class='c027'>Whenever this Proclamation is made known to the Princes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>and Rulers and Officers and People, they are to beware and
violate no precept contained therein.</p>

<p class='c027'>Proclamation made on the Thirteenth Day of the Eleventh
waxing Moon, in the Eleventh Year of His Majesty’s Reign,
October the Eighth, Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-Eight.</p>

<p class='c025'>The Edict furnishes a second natural division in the
history of the Lāo mission. Its first period was one of
struggle for its very existence, culminating in positive
prohibition to preach the gospel and virtual expulsion of
the missionaries. That situation was abruptly brought
to an end by the death of Prince Kāwilōrot and the
appointment of his son-in-law, Prince Intanon. In
our second period of struggle, the conclusion of which
we have just witnessed, the conditions were in many
respects similar to those of the first. Our chief antagonists
in the two contests were alike in their love
of absolute power, in their determination to break
down all rival influences, and alike, therefore, in their
settled hostility to our work. In neither case was their
antagonism to Christianity primarily on religious
grounds. But Kāwilōrot was of much more imposing
personality and figure than the Uparāt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within his own realm Kāwilōrot was really “Lord
of Life.” He was absolute head both of church and
of state. He brooked no rival and no contradiction in
either. The highest positions in the religious hierarchy
were bestowed or withdrawn at his pleasure.
His own brothers-in-law languished in exile in Siam,
because it was not thought safe for them to return
and be within his reach. At home he had vanquished
or terrified into submission all possible rivals. Even
the court of Siam seemed inspired with a wholesome
fear of meddling with him. The crime of the first
Christians was the unpardonable one that they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>dared to become such against the will of Kāwilōrot.
But the time and place for such rulers had passed.
Such attitude and temper suited neither a position
under superior authority, nor the policy of a government
striving to rise with the progress of the age.
But he served his purpose in the world, and Providence
used him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of his titular successor, Prince Intanon, and of his
noble wife, I have already spoken. His real successor
in the government of the land, and in his championship
of the old régime of feudal autocracy, was the Chao
Uparāt. But he had neither the commanding dignity
of Kāwilōrot nor his interesting personality;—had little,
in fact, of any of his qualities save his lodged and
settled hatred of all innovation. For him we had none
of a certain kind of respect which the late Prince inspired;
and we were under no constraint of gratitude
for favours. The only debt of gratitude the mission
owed him was for being, by his lawless acts, the unwitting
and unwilling cause of the proclamation of religious
freedom.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the crisis which he precipitated hastened likewise
that centralization of government which Siam was
waiting for. The tendency of the age is everywhere
toward centralization. Strong central governments
are everywhere taking the place of weak and scattered
ones. Chiengmai itself and all the existing Lāo states
have grown by the capture and absorption of their
weaker, though by no means insignificant, neighbours.
The authority and fear of Siam had long been felt indirectly
in preventing those petty wars in which one
weak state captured and enslaved another. That
authority was now to be exerted more directly to bring
to an end the era of arbitrary, personal, autocratic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>rule among its dependencies, and to establish in its
place the more equal and stable reign of law. Feudalism
with its “organized anarchy” was to give way to
the Nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the period at which we have arrived in this
narrative of our life and work in the Lāo states. It
is a wonderful thing to have lived through such a
series of changes, and possibly to have been, under
Providence, the means of bringing some of them about.
We work for an end apparent to ourselves; but God’s
designs are deeper and broader than ours. “He
maketh the wrath of man to praise Him.” Of nations,
as well as of individuals, is it true that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Rough-hew them how we will.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>Among the Christians the Edict, of course, was
greeted with an outburst of joy. To Nān Inta it was
like life from the dead. It was in reality freedom from
slavery. And no man made such efficient use of it as
he did. With the sealed copy of the Edict in his hand,
he returned to his village; and wherever he went he
could assure the people, on the faith of his Sovereign,
that a profession of the “Jesus-religion” meant neither
the ruffian’s club nor slavery. The effects of the Edict
upon the church will be traced in its future growth
as our story moves on. I may venture, however, to anticipate
so much—that within two years’ time two of
our strongest village churches were organized; one of
them in Nān Inta’s own village. Neither of these
churches could have existed had not the Uparāt’s
power been abridged.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the country, the new authority conferred on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>High Commissioner at that time has resulted in a
revolution as silent and as effectual as the change of
the seasons. His new title, Pū Samret Rāchakān—he
who fulfills the King’s work—was used, I believe, for
the first time in that proclamation; and it really
marked the passing of the sceptre from the hands of
the Princes of Chiengmai. The titular Chao Chīwit—Lord
of Life—was allowed to retain his title and
honours during his lifetime; but he has had no successor.
The Lāo country has ceased to be either a
feudal dependency or a separate “buffer-state.”
Silently—almost imperceptibly—it has become an integral
portion of the consolidated Kingdom of Siam.
Autocratic rule has everywhere ceased. And all these
changes are directly in line with the civilization of the
age.</p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c010'>XX<br /> <br />SCHOOLS—THE NINE YEARS’ WANDERER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The year 1879 opened auspiciously. In March a
little variety was introduced into our secluded
life by an official visit to Chiengmai of Major
Street, the British Commissioner at Maulmein. He
and his party arrived quite unexpectedly, spent a week
in the city, and attended an English service at the
mission on Sunday. We met them a number of times,
both socially and at official dinners. They strengthened
the position of the Commissioner, and did us all
good. But at that time we were anxiously awaiting
another arrival, in which we were more intimately concerned.
Mr. Wilson, who had been for two and a half
years absent on furlough, was daily expected, and with
him were our long-looked-for teachers for the Girls’
School.</p>

<p class='c009'>The party was to arrive on April 9th. To please
the three children and myself, on the afternoon of the
8th we four started down the river in a small boat
to meet and welcome them. But the river was low,
and we had not yet reached them when darkness came
on and we were obliged to seek moorings. When, at
last, we got ashore, we learned to our great joy that
the mission boats were moored only a few hundred
yards below, in the same bend of the river. We
all walked down in the moonlight, and presently spied
their lights close at hand. The young ladies had retired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to read, but not to sleep. The meeting by moonlight
at the river’s brink was quite romantic. We
talked till ten o’clock, though Mr. Wilson was so
hoarse that he could scarcely speak. At daybreak our
fleet was under way. We had a jolly breakfast together
on board—our visitors at their little table, and
we on the deck. We then visited hard again until
noon; but it was two o’clock before we caught sight
of the mission premises, with the native Christians
all waiting to greet the arrivals, old and new.</p>

<p class='c009'>The High Commissioner, a few days later, gave a
dinner to the mission, saying in the note of invitation
that it was in honour of the young ladies, for the boldness
and piety that enabled them to leave their fathers
and mothers, and come so far to teach his people.
When notified of their arrival, the Princess sent down
carriages and had us all up to call on her. She was
delighted to welcome the young ladies, and was interested
in the school.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The Siamese and the Lāo tongues are two closely related
branches of the same linguistic stock. The idiom
and the great body of common words are nearly the
same in the two, differing, where they do differ, chiefly
in accent and intonation. Siamese is, of course, the
speech of the ruling race throughout the Siamese kingdom;
and even at the time of which we are speaking
it was easy to foresee that the local dialect of its
northern provinces must eventually give way before it,
especially for all official and literary purposes. The
chief obstacle in the way of a speedy victory for the
Siamese has been the fact that the Lāo is written in a
wholly different character. Were the two alike in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>respect, there is no doubt that the standard form of
speech would take the place of the dialectal almost
without notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of necessity all teaching so far attempted had been
in the Siamese. There was not a schoolbook in the
Lāo character save the spelling tables. When these
had been mastered, there was no reading-book in Lāo
that could be put into the hands of the pupils; nor was
there prospect of any such being printed for years to
come. On the other hand, in the Siamese character
there was a considerable Christian literature in print,
both religious and general, already available for purposes
of education. Our pupils, moreover, had all been
girls; and almost no Lāo women at that time could
read writing in any character. It was, therefore, not
only much simpler, but quite as well for them on other
accounts, to learn the Siamese character from the
start.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, however, when we were arrived at the establishment
of regular schools with a permanent organization
and policy, the question could no longer be
postponed, In which language shall instruction be
given? It was not an easy question to decide. With
regard to it there was difference of opinion among the
missionaries, both old and new. On the one hand, it
was urged, that since ours was a Lāo mission, the Lāo
should, of course, be the language of the schools. On
the other hand were pointed out the greater scope and
availability of the Siamese, its assured supremacy, and
the dwindling future of the Lāo throughout the territory
of Siam. The matter at last was compromised by
continuing the Siamese in the Girls’ School, and adopting
the Lāo for the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime it was desirable to have some portions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the Scriptures in the Lāo character; and, to accomplish
this, the first requisite was a font of Lāo type. To this
end, on my first furlough in 1873, I went from North
Carolina to New York, and not only spent some time,
but was at some personal expense, in the effort to secure
such a font. The American Bible Society voted
a liberal sum for the purpose. But there turned out
to be some mechanical difficulties to be overcome in
making and using the type, which were beyond my
skill to solve. So, lest the attempt should fail in my
hands, I gave it up. And having accomplished nothing,
I presented no bill of expense either to the Bible Society
or to the Board.</p>

<p class='c009'>There seemed, indeed, to be some fatality attending
our efforts in this direction. Mr. Wilson, on the furlough
from which he was but now returned, had gone
further. He actually succeeded in getting a font of
Lāo type. But the whole of it was lost, and never
reached the mission.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c020'><sup>[11]</sup></a> It was not until Dr. Peoples’
furlough in 1889 that we succeeded in getting our present
type. Meanwhile we had used the Siamese Scriptures, with
some present disadvantages, indeed, but with
some advantages as well. Some of our first Christians
were attracted to our religion by their desire to learn
Siamese; and the Siamese Bible and catechism were
our textbooks. And now, under Siamese rule, knowledge
of the Siamese opens the way to promotion in the
government service. Siamese alone is taught in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>government schools. Young monks are more eager to
study Siamese than their own tongue.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f11'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Wilson brought only a few specimens with him. He
writes:—“The rest of the type was to be boxed up and sent to Mr.
Cutter, and the boxes were to be put away in the store-room of the
Mission Rooms at 23 Centre Street, and forwarded when called for.
They must have been lost when the Board moved from 23 Centre
Street to the Lenox property, and then to 156 Fifth Avenue.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But the important thing, after all, was that we had
a school actually begun, and that there was teaching
in <i>both</i> dialects. It was like a new beginning of our
work under conditions more favourable than at the
first. For twelve years it had been a hard, and, sometimes,
an apparently hopeless struggle. But the history
of missions affords many similar instances with
even fewer visible results. In twelve years we had
gathered forty converts into the church. Some of these
were among the most useful we have ever had in the
history of the mission. It is hard to estimate rightly
the importance of work spent on the foundations of
such an enterprise. But now, with that church organized,
with the medical work well established, the
evangelistic work strengthened, and the initial school,
begun long before by Mrs. McGilvary, placed on a permanent
basis, we could write in large letters on our
altar, “Jehovah-Nissi”—Jehovah our banner.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In the early part of this year, 1879, twelve more
persons were gathered into the church. One of them
was Pā Sêng Bun, the poor woman accused of witchcraft,
who, with so much difficulty, was saved from
her persecutors. Another was Mûn C., who was a
daily visitor when we were here on our first tour of
exploration. And another was our own dear little
Margaret. Somewhat later there came to our notice
one of the most interesting of all the incidents in the
chequered history of our mission. One morning, on
returning from my work in the city, I was told that
a man had been waiting to see me, and was then talking
to Nān Inta. Stepping down to the house, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>a number of persons had collected, I saw a handsome
man of medium height, but of striking figure, larger
and more portly than is usual among the Lāo, and
thirty-three years old, as I learned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nān Tā, for that was the stranger’s name, said that
not long after our first arrival in Chiengmai, while he
was yet a monk in the king’s monastery, he had visited
me, and was struck with those points in the teachings
of Christianity which differentiate it from
Buddhism. He received a copy of the Gospel of Matthew
in Siamese, learned a few verses, and took the
book home with him to the monastery. Afterwards
he visited me occasionally to take a few further lessons
in it. He was a protégé of Prince Kāwilōrot, who
paid the expenses of his entering the monastic order.
He thus became the Prince’s “Luk kêo”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c020'><sup>[12]</sup></a> (<i>jewel-son</i>),
in effect his adopted son. Not long after this he left
the priesthood, married, and settled out in the country.
But he paid us a few visits from time to time,
always, as he said, to talk on religion and to study
Siamese.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f12'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A designation whose nearest parallel in English is, perhaps, <i>god-son</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When the order for the murder of the Christians was
given, a monk who was a friend of his met him in the
streets, and asked whether he knew that his house was
to be burned over his head, explaining that the Prince
had nourished him as a son, and now he had apostatized
and joined the foreign religion. Advising him to consider
well and quickly, the priest hurried on. So it had
become known in the palace that he was visiting us
and studying the Jesus-religion. There was no time
to be lost, not even to bid good-bye to his young wife.
On that eventful Saturday afternoon, just before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>flight of our servants, he stopped at our door; but seeing
no one, he hastened on. On Sunday he secreted
himself in a deserted monastery near the mountains.
Next day he fell in with a company of traders, going
to Chieng Rāi, six days’ journey to the north, and
travelled with them without making known what his
errand was. At Chieng Rāi he learned that the Christians
were put to death the day after he left. He was
still within the Lāo realm, and might be arrested. He
made his way, therefore, to Keng Tung, in Burmese
territory, ten or fifteen days’ journey still further to
the north.</p>

<p class='c009'>After remaining there some three years, he returned
to Chieng Rāi, where he heard of the death of
Kāwilōrot and the accession of Prince Intanon. Still
in fear, he passed through the towns to the east of
Chiengmai, venturing even as near as Lakawn. Then
crossing the Mê Ping valley to the south of Chiengmai,
he went beyond the Salwin into Burma, stopping
awhile among the Red Karens, and then going on to
Maulmein. Seeing there a foreigner’s house, he enquired
if anything was known concerning the missionaries
in Zimme (Chiengmai). Nothing was known
of them. Returning again to Siamese territory, he
went to Rahêng, thinking that he would go on to
Bangkok. There, however, he was told that the missionaries
had gone back to the United States—information
based, no doubt, on our departure on furlough.</p>

<p class='c009'>During his long wanderings he had made friends as
he could, and to support himself had sometimes turned
peddler. In the haste of his flight from home he had
taken nothing with him except his copy of the Gospel
of Matthew in Siamese. He could not read it well, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>he kept it as a kind of talisman, till it was now well
worn. He had learned to pray daily. He never dared
to return till he heard of the Edict of Toleration. He
regarded it as a special providence that his wife,
strange to say, had not married again. The child born
after his flight he found grown to be a fine girl nine
years old. He was delighted to find the missionaries
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a thrilling story. This man did not have to
become a Christian—he was one already. His first
desire was to understand all that there was in his
Gospel of Matthew. It was evident that he had been
spared and kept for some wise purpose. And so it
proved. Since I needed a teacher, and since he was
a fine Buddhist scholar, I employed him as teacher,
so that I might have him near me in order to teach
him. He was an apt pupil, making rapid progress in
knowledge, and growing in grace. His romantic history
interested and attracted others. As a church
member, as a ruling elder, and afterwards as an ordained
minister, he was a power in the church till
the day when he was taken up. Thousands heard the
Gospel from his lips, and many were drawn by his
words and by his life into the fold of Christ.</p>

<p class='c009'>How wonderful are God’s ways in leading His people!
Doubtless the defection of this man was one of the
things which alarmed Kāwilōrot. It may even have
hastened the fate of the martyrs. But no doubt the
Lord chose a wonderful way of saving to His church
this most useful minister of the Gospel.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>After long-continued weakness on the part of Mrs.
McGilvary, an acute attack of pneumonia made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>longer stay in the country impossible. My daughter
Cornelia was taken ill at the same time. So, with
but little preparation, on December 28th, 1879, both
mother and daughter were carried in chairs to the
boat, and we hastened out of the country. Stopping
in Bangkok only a few days, we embarked for Hongkong.
We met the China Sea in its worst mood. For
three days and nights we did not see the captain’s face;
neither did he see sun, moon, or stars in that most
dangerous tract of the sea. The skylight was fastened
down, for the waves swept the vessel from stem to
stern. We were good sailors; but we could not but
pity the one hundred and twenty Chinese steerage
passengers, allowed on deck only a few moments twice
a day for a breath of air, after which they had almost
to be forced back into their hole again. There was
withal just enough of the spice of danger to make the
sight of Victoria Peak at last doubly welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time my family were all so much improved
by the journey that there was question whether I
should proceed with them, or should return to Chiengmai
for another year’s work. It was evident that, in
order to regain her strength, Mrs. McGilvary would
require a longer stay in the United States than one
year. I could neither spare the time for so long a
furlough for myself, nor could I expect the Board to
grant it. The question was not an easy one; but we
decided at last that my wife and children should continue
their journey to the United States, and that I
should return to Chiengmai alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>During my few days’ stay in Bangkok, through the
kindness of our Consul, I had an audience with His
Majesty the King. I desired to express to him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>person my thanks for the Edict of Toleration. After
some remarks addressed to the other gentlemen present,
the King asked me if I were not, during the previous
month, the bearer of despatches from his Commissioner
in the North—showing that he did not overlook
small matters, as a king might be expected to do. He
enquired how I liked the Commissioner, whether I
preached in Siamese or in Lāo, how many converts
we had, etc., etc. It was a very pleasant interview.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I ascended the river, it became plain that the
water was too low to permit the latter stage of the
trip to be made in my large boat. At Chiengmai I
should find a house, but not a home. Before I could
reach it, the touring season would be nearly over.
The thought of stopping a season for work at Rahêng
struck me favourably. The more I considered it, the
more attractive it became. To be sure, I had not secured
the sanction of the mission to that particular
enterprise; but I had always been allowed to choose
my own touring ground. An officer, Sên Utamā, offered
me a site for a bamboo house gratis; and before
I had announced my final decision, he and others began
to cut bamboo on it to build the house. I had
asked for guidance, and the question seemed to settle
itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot dwell on the interesting six months of the
year 1880 spent there. Sên Utamā was interested
from the first. By affliction he had been wonderfully
prepared for, and seemed to be waiting for, the very
consolation that the Gospel offered him. An ex-tax-collector,
a Chinese of some influence, was in the same
state of mind, and soon joined the other as an enquirer.
My student, Noi Intachak, entered heartily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>into the work. Soon, with my cook and boy, we had
the nucleus of quite an interesting congregation who
attended worship twice a day. It was a delight to
teach them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The case of the Chinese was deeply interesting. He
believed the Gospel plan of salvation, and was deeply
anxious to be saved from his sin and its punishment.
But there was one serious obstacle in the way of his
making an open profession—he had two wives. The
real wife—the one he had formally married—was childless.
The one he had bought was younger, and had two
lovable little children, both girls. I recall almost with
tears the burning questionings we had over that situation.
He seemed willing to make any self-sacrifice that
duty required. But what was duty? Should he divorce
one of them? If so, which one? “Of course, he
must keep the real one,” you will say. But what of
the young mother and the helpless babes? The very
mention of their being turned adrift, even with a
dower, had produced a scene in the family. The
poor woman felt quite unable to care for the children
alone. The children were his children. It might easily
have been the ruin both of mother and babes to put
her away. My heart was not hard enough to advise
that. Surely the man had not cut himself off from
the hope of salvation by his past—by an error or sin of
ignorance. The conditions of church-membership are
faith and repentance. The sacraments of the church
are baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Shall we offer a
man the pardon of his sin without its sacramental
seals?—the glorious hope of endless fellowship in
heaven, but not the communion of saints on earth?
A precisely parallel case I had met before in the person
of a native doctor at Mûang Awn. “What then,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the reader will ask, “did you do?” Why, in each case
I just did nothing. I followed the letter of the law,
and baptized neither one. But “the letter killeth; the
spirit maketh alive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In due time Sên Utamā and a nephew of the Chinese
were baptized. An interesting tour was made up the
river. But the station in Chiengmai was feeling the
pressure of the growing work. In July, 1880, the
church of Bethlehem was organized, and there were
promising openings in other districts. It was evident
that the Board was not in a condition to consider a
permanent station in Rahêng. It would have been an
interesting field for permanent occupation; but for
temporary work, I had been there as long a time as
we could afford to spend in one place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then Prayā Sīhanāt—the officer from Lakawn
who, two years before, had greeted me with “Ephphatha”—invited
me to return with him. His ears
were not opened, but his heart was. He had taught the
Christian faith to his wife and children and a few
others, and among these was a fellow ex-officer. He
wished with them to receive further and fuller instruction,
and to be taken into the fellowship of the church.
Without waiting to ascertain whether I could go, he
was come with a boat to bring me. This seemed
to me the guiding hand of providence, and I followed
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since a single boat cannot ascend the rapids without
the help of another boat’s crew, we made arrangements
to join forces with another party, and make
the trip together. The night before we were to start,
the river, which had been steadily rising, became a flood
so strong that my host dared not face it in his small
craft. Our companions, however, did not wait for us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>but went on as they had planned. We waited ten
days for another party, as well as for the river to go
down. Imagine my sensations, then, when, presently,
we learned that the captain and owner of the principal
boat in the flotilla with which we had planned to make
the trip, was shot and killed, and his boat was
plundered! A band of dacoits secreted themselves behind
a cluster of trees where the channel runs close
to the bank, shot the steersman at his oar, and then had
the boat at their mercy. Since all foreigners are supposed
to carry money, the attack may well have been
intended for me. Earlier in that same year, while
returning alone to Rahêng, I came near being entrapped
by a similar band.</p>

<p class='c009'>The visit to Lakawn was interesting and profitable.
Ten days were spent with the new converts. While
my friend, the Prayā, had been busy, the devil had not
been idle. One of the princes had threatened to have
one of his head men flogged if he joined the Christians.
But before we left, a church was organized, with Prayā
Sīhanāt as elder.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Lakawn I took elephants to Chiengmai, and
spent the last Sunday of my trip with Nān Inta and
the newly organized church of Bethlehem, named after
Mr. Wilson’s old church in Pennsylvania. Nān Inta
was waiting for me where the road to his village turned
off from the main route. On Christmas day following
this, Mr. Wilson, Dr. Cheek, and Miss Cole organized
yet another church at Mê Dawk Dêng, where Nān Suwan
had been doing faithful work. In both these cases
the persecution for supposed witchcraft had furnished
a good nucleus for the church, which thereafter the
Edict of Toleration protected from expulsion.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the departments of our work, medical, educational,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>evangelistic, were prospering. Nān Tā, the
long-time wanderer, was becoming a power second only
to Nān Inta, and destined ultimately to surpass him.
Like him, he was a man of fine address and bearing,
and a good Buddhist scholar; but he was much younger.
Being, moreover, the son of a Prayā—the highest grade
of Lāo officers—he had an influence with the nobility
such as no other of our Christians had. In the church
he began to show a capacity and power such as probably
no other person has exercised.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Mr. Wilson was working on plans for a
building for the Girls’ High School. Already the
school numbered forty-two pupils, but with no place
in which to teach them save the teacher’s house. The
season had been very hard on Miss Campbell’s health.
She was very young, and had come direct to Chiengmai
from the seminary without any period of rest, and
with a constitution by no means robust. The mission
voted her a trip to Bangkok for rest. Little did we
think when we bade her good-bye that we should see
her face no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Financially for me the year had been the hardest
in my life. With all the economy we could use—and
we did not spend a useless penny—it seemed impossible
for me to keep my family going. When we left Chiengmai
we had overdrawn our salary, and the amount had
to be made up that year. This condition was one of
the straws that helped to determine me to stop over
in Rahêng. I could live more cheaply there; in fact,
could hardly spend money there if I wished to. In
only one matter had I been greatly disappointed in
Rahêng; I hoped to be in somewhat closer communication
with my family, about whom I still felt some
anxiety. I was, indeed, nearer them in space, but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>proved much further in time. The largest mail of the
year passed on up to Chiengmai, and was sent back,
reaching Rahêng just after I had left the place. It
finally reached me in Chiengmai on the last day of the
year 1880!</p>

  <h2 id='ch21' class='c010'>XXI<br /> <br />SECOND FURLOUGH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>My health had been such that I hoped I might
safely forego my furlough, and have my wife
and our youngest child return to Chiengmai
alone. My wife, after finding a home for a while with
her brother, Professor Bradley, in Oakland, had gone
on in the spring to North Carolina. But she was not
gaining much in strength, and plainly required another
year. My own health was not so good as it was at
the beginning of the year. Certain symptoms gave me
anxiety, and decided me to delay my own furlough
no longer. If it was to be taken at all, the sooner the
better. So on March 12th, 1881, I started for the
United States. The furlough which was now beginning
ended twenty-three years of service in the general
field of Siam, and fourteen years spent among the Lāo.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had proceeded down the river but a few days, when
a passing boat brought the astounding intelligence of
the tragic death of our esteemed and youngest co-labourer,
Miss Mary Campbell. What words can express
the shock I received! The news was confirmed
a few days later by Dr. Cheek, whom I met on the
river. At this distance it is unnecessary to enlarge
on the particulars of the sad catastrophe. Indeed, it
was all so sudden that there were few particulars to
relate. Dr. Cheek had gone down to Bangkok on
business soon after Miss Campbell left us, and now was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>returning with Miss Campbell under his escort. At
the close of a hot day’s run, the boats lay moored by
a sand-bar for the night. They had had their evening
meal and worship together. Dr. Cheek had taken his
bath in the river, had examined the bar, and notified
Miss Campbell how far it was safe to venture in
taking hers. But somehow she ventured out too far—to
a depth from which only angelic arms could receive
her to a shore where there is no more death.</p>

<p class='c009'>The brave effort of her Lāo maid, Kam Tip, and Dr.
Cheek’s unsuccessful search till long after-life must
have been extinct, were well known at the time. She
had but just come to her chosen field of work, in the
bloom of youth and in the full ardour of her first consecration,
little thinking that her work was to be so
soon and so sadly closed. Her last written words to
a friend, with the ink on them scarcely dry before her
death, were: “But I am not alone, for I have found in
my dear Lāo girls, Bûk and Kam Tip, and in Nān Tā,
my teacher, more company than I ever expected. I
wish I could lend them to you long enough for you to
know them.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>It will be evident to all that in 1881 the working
force of the mission was entirely inadequate for occupying
and cultivating the broad and inviting field,
now opened to us as never before. The medical work,
constantly enlarging, occupied the physician’s whole
time. Mr. Wilson’s physical condition, never very
strong, confined his labours to the station and its
immediate vicinity. The attention which these alone
required would more than fill one man’s time. The
death of Miss Campbell made imperative an associate
for Miss Cole. So, even if the trip to the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>States had not been rendered imperative by considerations
of my own health, the best interests of the work
itself seemed to demand that some one should go to
seek reinforcement by direct and personal appeal to
the church at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Mrs. McGilvary, after spending the spring
of 1880 with her brother in Oakland, California, she
came on with our younger son to Statesville, North
Carolina, where she could be with our daughters, and
not far from our elder son in Davidson College.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my arrival in New York, I hastened on at once
to North Carolina, where I spent the summer with
my family and friends, lecturing from time to time in
the churches. The fall of this year I spent in Texas
and Arkansas, visiting relatives and friends who had
migrated thither from the family nest in North Carolina.
In Texas I attended the meeting of the Southern
Synod, and both there and elsewhere I found many
opportunities for presenting the cause of foreign missions;
and everywhere I encountered warm reception
and eager interest in the work among the Lāo. In the
winter I came north to visit the Theological Seminaries,
and to enlist men for the Lāo mission. On
my way I stopped in Oxford, Ohio, where I met Miss
Lizzie Westervelt (afterward Mrs. Stanley K.
Phraner), then in her senior year in Miss Peabody’s
Seminary, and preparing for missionary work among
the Lāo, upon which she entered in the following year.
This was the school which had given us Miss Mary
Campbell and Miss Edna Cole a few years before.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>While waiting for the Theological Seminaries to re-open
after the Christmas recess, I was the guest of
my wife’s cousins at Castleton Corners, Staten Island.
There I had the very pleasant experience of observing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Watch Night” with the Moravian Church, of which
my friends were members. They called on the Lāo
missionary for an account of his experience in the field.
In that, of course, there was nothing remarkable. But
near the close of the next year, when writing to the
family, I alluded to the pleasant memory of Watch
Night and sent my greetings to the church with a request
to be remembered in their prayers. Instead of
giving my message verbally, my friends read the letter
itself, and it seemed to be appreciated. The result was
that the Lāo letter came to be looked for regularly as a
part of the watch service, and one was sent to them
every year—if I were on the field—for seventeen years.
It was a comfort to know that special prayer was always
offered for us by that great missionary church
as the old year was dying, and the new year was coming
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Professors at Princeton, Union, and Allegheny
all gave their cordial endorsement and aid to me in
my efforts to secure men. “We want you to get our
best men,” they said, and the Lord gave them to us.
From Princeton came Chalmers Martin of the senior
class. He had been chosen, however, for the Hebrew
Fellowship, and was, therefore, delayed a year before
entering upon his missionary work. Though his career
in the Lāo field was a short one, he left a lasting
mark there, as we shall see. Allegheny gave us Rev.
S. C. Peoples, M.D., and his brother-in-law, Rev. J. H.
Hearst. Dr. Peoples’ bow still abides in strength.
His double preparation both as a minister and as a
physician, gave him unusual equipment for the work
he has accomplished. Mr. Hearst, however, soon succumbed
to the Chiengmai climate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Union gave us that consecrated young man, McLaren,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>who chose the great city of Bangkok—a fitting
field for him, since his broad sympathies were bounded
by no one race or people. His career also was cut
short within a few months by cholera, contracted while
ministering to dying seamen in the harbour during a
severe epidemic of the disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Northwestern Woman’s Board of Foreign Missions
was then, as it has been since, a great centre of
missionary enthusiasm. It had sent out Miss Cole and
Miss Campbell; and now the sudden death of the latter
had caused its interest and that of the Chicago
churches to concentrate upon the Lāo mission. It was
to this combination of circumstances that I was indebted
for an invitation to attend its Annual Meeting
in Minneapolis, and to speak there. Then the appointment
of Dr. L. E. Wishard’s daughter (afterwards Mrs.
Dr. Fulton of Canton, China), and that of Miss Sadie
Wirt (Mrs. Dr. S. C. Peoples), from his church in
Chicago, gave me a pleasant visit in the Doctor’s family
both as I went up to Minneapolis and as I returned.
On a Sunday at Lake Forest, between the
Sunday School, the University, the Ladies’ Seminary,
and the church, the Lāo Mission had four hearings.
At Minneapolis we learned that Miss Warner from the
Northwestern Woman’s Board, and Miss Griffin from
the Southwestern, were also appointed to our mission,
and Miss Linnell to Lower Siam. This completed our
number, the largest reinforcement the mission has ever
received at one time.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the adjournment of the Northwestern Board,
a Sunday was spent with the family and the church of
Miss Mary Campbell. After that, appointments with
other churches filled up my time till the meeting of the
General Assembly in Springfield, Illinois, which I attended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>though not as a delegate. Our Presbytery of
North Laos had not then been organized, and Dr. E. P.
Dunlap was the representative of the Presbytery of
Siam. At that meeting it seemed to me that a golden
opportunity was missed for drawing together in a
closer union the Northern and the Southern branches
of the Presbyterian Church. The outcome threw the
Southern church, much more weakened by the war
than the Northern, on its own resources. In proportion
to its financial strength, it has developed into one
of the strongest missionary churches in the land, both
as regards the home work and the foreign. Meantime,
with the growth of the country generally, the Northern
Assembly is becoming too unwieldy a body for its best
efficiency. I believe the time will come when there
will be three Assemblies rather than one, with a
triennial Assembly of all on a basis of representation
agreed upon by the three—somewhat after the plan
of the Methodist and the Episcopal churches; or, more
nearly still, after the plan of the Pan-Presbyterian
Council.</p>

<p class='c009'>In duties and pleasures such as have just been described,
the time slipped by till it was the 6th of
June, 1882, before I again reached my family in Statesville.
We were to start Lāo-ward about the middle of
July. My furlough ended with a visit to my old charge
at Union, to attend the dedication of a new church
there, and to see my old friends once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>We began to gather up our scattered forces at Chicago,
where the Fifth Church gave to its pastor’s
daughter, and to the rest of us there present, a hearty
farewell. The others of our large party joined us at
different points on our route across the continent. Dr.
Eugene P. Dunlap and his family, also returning from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>furlough, were the very last to join us, just in time to
sail with us from San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>A missionary’s vacation is very delightful, but the
last day of it—the day that brings him back to his
home and his work—is the best of it all. The small
Bangkok steamers of those days could not furnish accommodation
for our whole party at once. Some of
us were, therefore, compelled to lie over at Canton—a
circumstance which changed the ultimate location of
one of our young ladies to the Canton mission, just as
a previous successor to Miss Campbell had in a similar
manner been changed to another station in China.
But where there are young folks, such accidents will
happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Bangkok our United States Consul, General
Partridge, arranged for us an audience with the King.
His Majesty gave us a cordial reception, expressing his
gratification at seeing so many American missionaries
coming to his country; since he knew that they came
to instruct his people, and to make them more intelligent
and better citizens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reinforcements surely had not come too soon. Dr.
Wilson, Mrs. Cheek, and Miss Cole were the only missionaries
on the field when we returned; for Dr. Cheek
was absent on business. It was now four years since
the proclamation of religious toleration; and for the
first time was there prospect of workers enough to make
any use of the advantages it offered.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>But had we relied too much on human aid? Were
we too much elated in view of our present numbers,
with Mr. Martin to follow the next year? After a
short stay in Bangkok, we reached Chiengmai in the
midst of one of those violent epidemics of fever by
which the Lāo country was then, perhaps, more frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>visited than it is now. Mr. and Mrs. Hearst
and Miss Warner were soon prostrated with the disease,
and at one time, out of the whole mission, scarcely
enough were left to care for the sick. Mr. and Mrs.
Hearst soon decided to give up the struggle and withdraw
from the field. Miss Warner continued longer,
but ultimately she, too, retired with broken health.
As already stated, Mr. McLaren died of cholera after
a few hours’ sickness in Bangkok. God was teaching
us that it is “not by might nor by power, but by My
Spirit, saith Jehovah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon other complications arose. Smallpox was
brought by pupils into the Girls’ School, and, to our
consternation, Miss Griffin fell a victim. She had been
vaccinated in her childhood, but was not revaccinated
on leaving home—which is always a wise precaution
for those expecting to travel or to live in the East.
Proper measures prevented further spread of the disease;
and though our patient had a rather hard attack,
yet she made good recovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>During our absence, the church had sustained a great
loss in the death of Nān Inta, our first convert and assistant.
But his works do follow him, and his life
will long continue to be a precious legacy to the Lāo
church. He lived, however, until others were ready to
take his place. Nān Sī Wichai, who long had been
Dr. Cheek’s teacher, was a strong character, and he was
ordained as an elder. Nān Tā, also, who had wandered
so far and so long after the persecution, was growing
to be a power in the church, and afterwards had the
honour of becoming the first ordained minister among
the Lāo.</p>

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c010'>XXII<br /> <br />A SURVEYING EXPEDITION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>On the 26th of February, 1884, an East Indian
appeared on our veranda with an unexpected
note from my old guest and friend, Rev. Dr. J.
N. Cushing of the American Baptist Shan Mission.
The surprise and pleasure of a visit from him and Mrs.
Cushing in the early and lonesome days of the mission
have already been referred to. The note told us that
he was now connected, as interpreter, with a surveying
expedition under Holt S. Hallett, Esq., and that the
party would arrive in Chiengmai on the following day.
The railroad for which Mr. Hallett was surveying a
route was part of a scheme, then on foot, to build a
road from Maulmein to Chiengmai, there to connect
with a road from Bangkok, through the Lāo country,
to Chieng Sên, and, if successful, to be continued up
to Yunnan, China. For some reason the scheme was
not carried out, but the prospect of any road to connect
our isolated field with the outside world was attractive
to us.</p>

<p class='c009'>The party arrived the next day; and since it would
be very inconvenient for Mr. Hallett to be separated
from Dr. Cushing, we found room in our house for
Mr. Hallett also, and had a fine visit with both. They
soon began to tempt me to join their expedition. All
expenses were to be paid. They were not to travel on
Sunday. Their intended route, through the towns and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>villages on the way to Chieng Rāi and Chieng Sên, and
southward again to Lakawn, was over ground I was
anxious to travel once more. The trip would give me
a long and profitable visit with my friend, Dr. Cushing.
But, besides all personal considerations, it seemed
right to give a little aid to an enterprise that would
redound to the good of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Chiengmai Prince, then quite old, was most incredulous
as to the possibilities of the wonderful railroad.
In his book, <i>A Thousand Miles on an Elephant
in the Shan States</i>, Mr. Hallett has given an amusing
account of his first interview with the Prince. He had
great difficulty in understanding how a train could
move faster than ponies, or how it could move at all
without being drawn by some animal. And how could
it ascend the hills? For it would surely slide down
unless it were pulled up. “I explained to him that I
had made three railways in England, therefore he
might rely upon what I had said. Railways were
made in various parts of the world over much more
difficult hills than those lying between Zimme (Chiengmai)
and Maulmein.... He seemed quite stupefied
by the revelation. It might be so—it must be so, as I
had seen it; but he could not understand how it could
be. He was very old; he could not live much longer.
He hoped we would be quick in setting about and constructing
the line, as otherwise he would not have the
pleasure of seeing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We started at last on March 3d, 1884, with four
large riding elephants, four pack-elephants, and numerous
carriers, making forty-one persons in all. The
passport from the Siamese government, supplemented
by one from the acting Commissioner, and the presence
with us of a Lāo official of some rank, sent to see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the orders were carried out, secured for us men and
elephants and all necessary equipments, so far as the
country could furnish them. The local officials were
usually very kind, and as prompt as native officials
ever were in those days. Mr. Hallett was very considerate
in arranging to stop for the night and on
Sundays near large villages and towns, where a little
missionary work could be done. In the cities where
there were Christians, we held regular services on
Sundays. On these occasions our chief gave the influence
of his presence, though, of course, he could
not understand what was said.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this trip we had a good opportunity for studying
the characteristics of the elephant. He is very conscious
of his dignity, and must be treated with the
respect due to a king, and not with the familiarity of
an equal. Yet one is amused at his timidity. I myself
have seen one ready to stampede if a squirrel or
a big rat ran across the road in front of him. Mr.
Hallett says: “Elephants, though immense in size, are
very timid, and easily startled. We had to take them
off the path and turn their heads away into the
jungles, whenever we heard the tinkling bells of an approaching
caravan; and they will turn tail and run at
the sight of an audacious little dog that thinks fit to
bark at them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On some of the stages of our march, when we had a
mother-elephant in our company, we had the mischievous
youngster along. Such are always an unceasing
source of amusement. One of these seemed to
have a special spite against Mr. Hallett’s Madras boy,
either because of his peculiar dress, or for some liberty
he had taken with him. Mr. Hallett writes: “The
little elephant was taking every chance he could get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to hustle the men over as they forded the streams, and
to souse them with water from his trunk. Portow,
who had an overweening opinion of his own dignity,
and was bent on setting up as an oracle, was, unfortunately,
the butt of the boys, but was likewise the
sport of the baby-elephant. Many a time have I seen
him hustled over by the youngster, who seemed to
have picked him out as his playmate. Slyly and softly
stealing up behind, he would suddenly increase his
pace, and, with a quick shuffle or a sudden lurch,
shoulder him sprawling to the ground. Portow, during
this part of the journey, behaved like a hunted man,
ever looking behind to see whether the dreadful infant
was behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My friend, Dr. Cushing, who had been put in charge
of the train, and our prince-guide, both believed in the
oriental idea of making an impression by as imposing
a pageant as possible. On nearing Chieng Rāi, they
marshalled us in procession, so that we entered the
city in state, with ten armed men leading the way.
Possibly it had its desired effect, for a warm welcome
was given us, and every aid was granted.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the eleven years since my first visit there with
Dr. Vrooman, the city had grown in size. The fertility
of its soil and the large extent of its arable land
were sure to attract still larger population from the
south. In addition to these natural advantages, it had
then another strong claim for a mission station. While
all the other Lāo states, through their rulers, submitted
to the introduction of Christianity rather than welcomed
it, Chieng Rāi and Chieng Sên were exceptions.
The rulers of both desired the presence of the missionaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sunday spent there was a welcome day of rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The week had been a strenuous one. In the morning
we held a public service—the first ever held there.
Mr. Hallett and our prince-guide attended, and curiosity
collected quite a congregation. After tiffin, Dr.
Cushing and I spent several hours—the first quiet ones
we had had—reading in the monastery grounds at the
great bend of the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening I met the governor at home and, save
for the presence of his wife, alone. His intelligent
enquiries as to the truths and teachings of our religion
showed that he had already thought much on the
subject. Krū Nān Tā and he were not very distant
relatives, and had had many conversations on the subject.
His regard for our mission and his earnest
desire for a mission station, as well as the protection
he afterwards gave the Christians when they were
wronged, had, I believe, a deeper foundation than an
intellectual interest, or even a personal friendship
for us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our next stage was Chieng Sên. There Nān Suwan,
our ruling elder, and his family gave us a warm welcome.
He met us at the city gate, hardly hoping there
would be a missionary in the expedition, which, rumour
told him, was coming. His house stood on the bank of
the river, just where Dr. Vrooman and I landed thirteen
years before, when the only occupants were wild
beasts. The new settlers had been so busy providing
housing and sustenance for themselves, that only one
monastery building had been roofed, and only a portion
of its images stored under shelter. Our old
friend the governor had only a bamboo residence. Nān
Suwan had made friends by the help of the quinine
with which he had been supplied, and he had the best
house in the city. It served, also, as a chapel, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>which, with grateful hearts, we worshipped on
Sunday.</p>

<p class='c009'>The governor was even more insistent in his demand
for a mission station than the governor of Chieng Rāi
had been. He even offered to send down elephants to
move us up, if we would come. His was not the deep
religious nature of the Chieng Rāi governor. He possibly
believed that in their sphere all religions were
alike good. He urged, as he had done before, that we
might even then forestall the monasteries and preoccupy
the field. Nothing would have pleased me
more, had it been possible, than to accept the cordial
invitation. It was true, as the governor said, “The
people must and will have some religion. If you do
not give them Christianity, they must take Buddhism.”
It was only necessity that could resist such a plea.
But half a loaf is better than no bread. If we were
not ready to start a regular station in Chieng Sên, we
must somehow work the field as best we could. That
consideration determined my long tours in the dry seasons
of the years that followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to this time I had never been properly equipped
and outfitted for such tours. One outcome of this trip
was a great improvement in my means of transportation
for the future. An application made long before
this to the Board for an elephant, had been received as
a huge joke. But now it happened that in the assignment
of elephants for our upward trip, a large <i>sadaw</i>—a
male without tusks—had fallen to me. He proved to
be an exceptionally fine beast belonging to an estate
about to be divided. He must be sold, and was held at
a very cheap figure. With the help of a contribution by
Mr. Hallett, and the hire paid for its use, I was able to
purchase it. The deputy governor gave me a good howdah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>for it. I was as proud of my new acquisition as
ever a boy was of a new toy. But since few elephants
will travel well alone, I now needed a mate for him.
Before long I was fortunate enough to get a cheap and
equally good female. I was then prepared for my long
tours. I could cross streams in safety, and be protected
from rain, even if my journey were prolonged beyond
the limits of the dry season.</p>

<p class='c009'>On our return journey, in Mûang Payao, we came in
contact with the worst epidemic of smallpox that I
have ever seen. We met it at every turn in the street.
With difficulty could we keep parents with children, all
broken out with the disease, in their arms, from crowding
round us in our sālā. We had hardly taken our
seats on the rugs spread for us at the governor’s official
reception of Mr. Hallett, when we discovered
cases of smallpox all about us. Dr. Cushing was
nervously afraid of it, and retired. I had to remain
an hour as interpreter. Imagine our consternation on
reaching the next station to find that the Doctor
showed unmistakable signs of having contracted the
dreadful disease, although he had been vaccinated in
his youth. What a discovery to be made on a journey,
and four days from home! On consultation it was
thought best to hasten on to Chiengmai, a thing which
our mode of travel made possible. Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers
Martin had arrived during our absence, and had
taken up their quarters in our house. It was, therefore,
impossible to take our sick friend in. We did
the next best thing, and gave him a new bamboo house
on our hospital lot, where Dr. Peoples carefully
watched over him till he made a rapid recovery, and
was able to return home in a boat as far as Bangkok,
and thence by sea <i>via</i> Singapore. It was a sad close,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>however, to our pleasant visit together, and to our
otherwise interesting and profitable tour.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I returned from Chieng Sên, as we have seen, with
an elephant of my own. On reaching home I found
awaiting me the best pony I ever had. It was sent
to me as a present from the governor of Mê Hawng
Sawn, near the Salwin River. I had never been to Mê
Hawng Sawn, and had but a very limited acquaintance
with the governor. According to my uniform custom
in those days, on his official visits to Chiengmai, I had
twice called upon him as the governor of a neighbouring
province. On both occasions we had conversation
on the different merits of the two religions. On one
of these visits he had brought down some ponies to sell,
and on my asking the price of one he said, “I am
very sorry that I have sold all my gentle ones. There
is only one left. If you can use him, I shall be glad
to give him to you.” It is a McGilvary trait not to
be timid about horses, and I said, “I will try him.”
So the pony was sent down to my house; but he proved
rather too much for my horsemanship. The first time
I mounted him, he threw me and sprained my wrist.
It was the unanimous vote of the family that he be
returned with thanks. The governor sent back word
that he was very sorry; but never mind; when he
reached home he would see to it that I had a good
pony—a message which, I am sorry to say, I took as a
good oriental compliment. I had even forgotten all
about the matter, when, on my return from this trip,
I found the pony in my stable. He was a most
valuable and timely present.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we are not quite done with Mr. Hallett’s survey.
He made a short excursion without an interpreter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>to the hot Springs. But his final trip was to be
to Mûang Fāng, six days to the north and west of the
route previously taken, and distant some eighty-three
miles from Chiengmai. His object was to see if there
were not an easier route to Chieng Rāi down the valleys
of the Mê Fang and the Mê Kok. The trip
strongly appealed both to Mr. Martin and to me, and
we gladly accepted Mr. Hallett’s invitation to accompany
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Fāng was an ancient city captured and destroyed
by the Burmese in 1717; so that it lay in
ruins nearly two hundred years before it was re-peopled.
Besides Mûang Fāng, we visited, either in going or returning,
four other cities—Chieng Dāo, Mûang Ngāi,
Mûang Pāo, and Mûang Kên. Not far to the south of
Mûang Fāng we visited the cave of Top Tao, noted in
the Buddhist legends of Northern Siam. Mr. Hallett
thus describes our experiences there:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Inside was a lofty cavern lighted by a natural skylight.
On a raised platform in the cave was a great reclining
image of Buddha some thirty feet long, and around it a
number of figures representing his disciples. Numerous
small wooden and stone images of Buddha had been placed by
pious pilgrims about the platforms. Pillows, mattresses,
robes, yellow drapery, flags, water-bottles, rice-bowls, fans,
dolls, images of temples, doll’s houses for the spirits, and
all sorts of trumpery, were lying together with fresh and
faded flowers that had been offered to the images, and were
strewn in front of them. A steep ladder led up to niches
near the roof of the cave, in which images were enshrined.</p>

<p class='c027'>“My companions, full of ardor, determined to explore
the inner recesses of the cave, and accordingly lighted their
torches and proceeded further into the bowels of the earth,
whilst I enjoyed a quiet smoke amongst the gods. Down
they went, creeping through low, narrow passages, over rocks,
and along ledges, with chasms and pits lining their path as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the cave expanded—bottomless as far as they could judge by
the faint light of their torches, but really not more than
twenty or thirty feet deep—until they could get no further,
and had to return, having proceeded about the eighth of
a mile.”</p>

<p class='c025'>That night brought us to the Mê Fāng River. The
narrative proceeds:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Here we spent the most unpleasant night we had yet
spent, as we were troubled with rain, heat, and mosquitoes.
We were told that game was plentiful. Wild cattle larger
than buffaloes come in droves from the hills to graze in the
plain, while the rhinoceros and the elephant roam about
the plains.</p>

<p class='c027'>“At our next stopping-place, after we had settled ourselves
in an empty house, a villager came to inform us that
the house belonged to the Chief of Mûang Fāng, and that
anybody that slept in it would have his head cut off. As
rain was threatening, we determined to risk the penalty,
and we were soon glad that we had done so, as the rain
poured down in torrents.”</p>

<p class='c025'>There is a small deer called tamnê, which twenty
years ago was very abundant in all the northern
provinces. They are not found in the very tall grass
of the river-bottoms, but in grass about waist-high
thickly covering the higher plains. They have their
beds in this grass by day, and graze at night. They
are lower than the grass, and never leap so as to show
the body, but glide smoothly along as if swimming, discovering
their presence only through the parting and
waving of the grass. Sometimes you get right upon
them before they will run.</p>

<p class='c009'>One Saturday we got Mr. Hallett interested in some
survey or calculations not requiring the aid of an interpreter,
and Mr. Martin and I had our first deer hunt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>We took six of our elephants, and, going out about an
hour’s ride or more from the city, we formed in open
order abreast, about forty yards apart, and in perfect
silence moved forward over the plain. The hunter
thus starts his own game. He sits on the back, or,
better still, on the neck of his elephant, with gun
cocked, ready for a shot at the first noise or movement
in the grass. We started about a dozen of the
deer, and emptied many cartridges, but came back to
camp with no meat—much to Mr. Hallett’s disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Fāng, like Chieng Sên, was rich in images
of all sizes and materials. I never saw finer bronze
ones. It was a favourite field from which Siamese
princes and officials could get a supply otherwise unattainable
in those days. Of course, <i>they</i> have a right
to them. But when a German traveller undertook a
wholesale speculation in the images of Buddha, it was
quite another matter, and he got into serious difficulty
with the government.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after our return to Chiengmai, Mr. Hallett left
us for Bangkok. From his long residence in Burma
and from his close connection with the mission and
missionaries during his expedition among what he
calls the Shan States, he understood the methods and
results of missionary work better than most visitors
who have written upon the subject. The kind words
of the dedication of his book, though often quoted,
may well conclude this chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the American Missionaries in Burma and Siam
and the Shan States I dedicate this book, as a mark
of the high esteem in which I hold the noble work the
American Baptist Mission and the American Presbyterian
Mission are accomplishing in civilizing and
Christianizing the people of Indo-China.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c010'>XXIII<br /> <br />EVANGELISTIC TRAINING</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>On our return from the surveying expedition in
the summer of 1884, we found F. B. Gould,
Esq., our first British Vice-Consul, already
established in Chiengmai. It was an important event
for the country; since a British official in any place is
a guarantee that at least the outward forms of law
and justice will be observed. In one important sense,
too, it marked a new era for the mission, or, at least,
for the missionaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who have not tried can hardly imagine the privation
of living eighteen years without a mail system
of any kind. Our only dependence so far was on
catching chance trading boats to and from Bangkok.
These were always an uncertain quantity; in very low
water they almost ceased to travel. Some boatmen
preferred not to be responsible for the mail, not knowing
what it might contain. In the great city of Bangkok,
and even in Chiengmai, it required a constant effort
to keep ourselves informed of the departures of
boats. The consequence was that an absence of news
from children, friends, and the outside world generally,
for three or four months at a time, was very common.
Sometimes the interval was as much as eight
months. Add to this the time of the long river trip,
and our news sometimes would be nearly a year old
when it reached us. Mr. Wilson’s family and mine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>had schooled ourselves to these conditions; but to
those who had been accustomed to a daily mail, they
must have been almost unendurable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new Vice-Consul came, determined by all means
to get some regular communication established, if it
were only a monthly one. We were only too glad to
do whatever we could to that end. It was a matter
of pride to both parties that we arranged at once for
a regular and most successful semi-monthly mail overland
to Maulmein. I furnished a reliable Christian
man for chief contractor, and good men for carriers.
Since Mr. Gould had as yet no authority from his government
to incur any expense, the arrangement was
wholly a private affair, with the understanding that
all who availed themselves of it should pay a quarterly
assessment for the maintenance of the line. But in a
short time the British government assumed the whole
expense. Mr. Gould promised to get the staff exempt
from corvée, or compulsory government service. He
had to use his official authority for that.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lāo government had absolutely no interest in
a mail, whether weekly or yearly; but the Siamese
looked rather askance at having in their own country
a mail service over which they had no control.
It seemed to be in some way a reflection on their national
pride. There is little doubt that our private
enterprise hastened the weekly government mail from
Bangkok, which was started the next year. And since
the Maulmein route is quicker by two weeks than
the one by Bangkok, the Siamese government has of
late maintained both, the two meeting at Rahêng, and
giving us a very creditable and regular mail service.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In the spring of 1884 the mission sustained a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>loss in the death of Princess Tipa Kēsawn, Prince Intanon’s
consort, whom we were in the habit of calling
“the Queen.” Placed as she was, she could not well
have avoided the making of priests’ garments, and the
going through with the form of making offerings to the
spirits. But I seriously doubt whether she had any expectation
of laying up thereby a store of merit for the
future. One thing we do know, that in her last sickness
she turned no anxious look to any of these things,
at a time when thoughtful Buddhists are always most
diligent in their efforts. Dr. Peoples of our mission
attended her in her last illness, and the case was submitted
entirely to him. Mrs. McGilvary and I were
both with her the day before she died. Mrs. McGilvary
was with her at her death, and remained to see
the body dressed for the coffin. We missed her very
much as a friend, and the whole country missed her as
a balance-wheel for her husband.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>On the arrival of the reinforcement in 1883, a Presbytery
was organized of the four ministers, Wilson,
Peoples, Hearst, and McGilvary. I was then full of
the idea of a theological training-class. My experience
of the accumulated power added to the missionary’s
efforts by having such assistants as Nān Inta,
Nān Suwan, and Noi Intachak, raised in my mind the
question, Why not increase the number? Having had
no schools, we had, of course, no body of young men
educated on Christian lines whom we might train for
the ministry; and we could not have such for years
to come. But we had in our churches mature men of
deeply religious nature, earnest students of Buddhism,
and carefully educated in all the learning of their race.
And a man so trained has many compensations for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>his lack of training in our elementary schools. He
knows the sacred books of his own people, their
strength and their weakness. He understands the
thoughts, the needs, and the difficulties of a Buddhist
enquirer, and the mode of argument by which these
difficulties are to be met, as no young man of his own
race, and as no foreign teacher can do. The training
needed to make such a man an efficient preacher of the
Gospel, is training in the Christian Scriptures, together
with practical experience in evangelistic work
under efficient direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was at that time giving regular instruction to Noi
Intachak, one of the finest young men I have ever
known in that country, and very anxious to become a
minister.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c020'><sup>[13]</sup></a> To Nān Tā, afterwards our efficient minister,
I was giving instruction less regularly, as it
was possible for him to take it. But it would have
been both easier and more profitable to teach a class
of six or eight. By qualifying such a group of young
men to work, and then working with them and through
them, I believed that my own efficiency could be
quadrupled, or even sextupled, as it was doubled when
I had Nān Inta to work with.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f13'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our hopes for his future career, alas, were cut short by his untimely
death in the following year.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With these thoughts and this experience impressed
on my mind, and in order that my plan, if adopted,
might have the ecclesiastical sanction of the Presbytery
as well as the corporate sanction of the mission,
I had urged the organization of the Presbytery
just as soon as we had the minimum quorum required.
In order to give the discussion its proper outlook and
perspective, I noticed, also, in the paper which I read
before the Presbytery, the necessity of a general education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>for all our Christians, and of High Schools for
both sexes; while I sketched more in detail the nature
and the methods of special instruction intended for
those in training to become evangelists and ministers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The training proposed for this last group was intended
primarily to equip the most capable and most
promising individuals among the converts for filling
well their places as lay officers and leaders in the
churches, and for engaging intelligently in evangelistic
work. But beyond this it was thought that it would
ultimately furnish a body of picked men from whom
again the best might be chosen as candidates for
further instruction leading up to the ministerial office.
The course was to be flexible enough to permit
occasional attendance with profit on the part of men
whose household duties or whose business would not
permit them to attend regularly. Its special feature
was actual and constant practice in evangelistic work
under the direction and supervision of the Principal,
and with him as his assistants on his tours.</p>

<p class='c009'>In view of the poverty of the Lāo generally, and in
order to make it possible for these men to maintain
their families while occupied with this training, it was
further proposed that they should receive a moderate
allowance of, perhaps, eight rupees per month of actual
service, or about three dollars of our money. This
seemed not unreasonable, since in Christian lands it
is thought a wise provision to assist students in their
preparation for the ministry; and since what is required
to support one European missionary family,
would support half a dozen fairly educated native
ministers or ten good native evangelists.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Presbytery took hold of the scheme with much
ardour, and at once began to organize it into shape,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>but on far too large a scale, and with far too formidable
and too foreign apparatus. A regular “Board
of Education” was created, with rules and regulations
better suited to American conditions than to those of
the Lāo churches. A committee was further appointed
to examine all applicants for the course, much after
the manner of receiving candidates for the ministry
under the care of a Presbytery. Their “motives for
seeking the ministry” were to be enquired into, while
as yet it was not at all known whether they would
desire to become ministers. The allowance in each
case was to be the absolute minimum which it was supposed
would suffice for the maintenance of the student
after he had provided all that he could himself.
Noi Intachak, for example, was allowed the maximum
of eight rupees a month, while Noi Chai—one of the
best Buddhist scholars in the country, a young man
with a family, living ten miles away in the country—was
allowed five rupees, on the ground that he was not
very poor; while yet another was allowed but three.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this ordeal—which was thought to be a good
test of their sincerity—the rest of the six or eight candidates
for instruction declined to commit themselves.
None of them understood exactly what the Board of
Education was about. I myself was greatly disappointed
at the outcome. After a week of listless study,
Noi Chai begged to be allowed to withdraw, and the
whole thing was disbanded. My hopeful private class
was killed by too much “red tape,” and with it all possibility
of a training-class for four years to come. I
was again set free for long tours and my favourite
evangelistic work.</p>

<p class='c009'>I continued to teach Noi Intachak till his lamented
death, and I devoted what spare time I could to teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the long-time wanderer, Nān Tā, who had become our
best evangelist. There seems to have been some fatality
connected with all our efforts to establish a theological
training school. When the next attempt was
made, under Mr. Dodd’s direction, with a large and interesting
class enthusiastically taught, through some
cause or combination of causes—for it would be difficult
to specify any single one as alone determinative—it
was allowed to slip out of our hands. Possibly a
leading cause in this case was the same that was
operative in the other. At a time when the mission
was pressing the idea of self-support to its breaking
point, an allowance probably too scanty was offered
in the evangelistic work to the men who had been
trained for it. The whole question in the Lāo field,
as it doubtless is in others, is a difficult one. As wages
in other departments rise, and the demand for competent
men becomes more pressing both in governmental
and in private business, the question will become
more difficult still. While on the one hand there
is the danger of making a mercenary ministry, on the
other hand we must remember that, the world over,
educated labour now costs more, but is not, therefore,
necessarily dearer. The same penny-wise and pound-foolish
policy has lost us the strength of some of the
best men in our church, our schools, our hospitals, and
our printing-press, because more lucrative positions
are offered elsewhere. But we must remember first of
all that theological schools, like all others, are not
made, but grow; and, second, that the law of competition
prevails here, too, as well as elsewhere. It is
easy to say that it ought not to do so, as between the
ministry and other professions, or between the missionary
work and other more lucrative callings. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>to a certain extent the same law does hold, and it is
a fact to be reckoned with.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In May, 1884, H. R. H. Prince Krommamûn Bijit, a
brother of the King of Siam, arrived and took up his
residence in Chiengmai—probably to give prestige to
the High Commissioner, and possibly to smooth the
road of the new British Consul. It was an open secret
that the Prince of Chiengmai could see no need whatever
for a British Resident, and at times he was not
slow to make his views known. For a while the relations
between the two were somewhat strained. Yet it
was of the utmost importance that the relations between
England and Siam should remain cordial. At
the same time it was a part of the plan of Siam, since
fully carried out, to assume complete control of the
government in the northern states. What was of more
special interest to us was, as we shall see, not only
that Prince Bijit was personally friendly, but that he
brought with him substantial evidence of the good will
of His Majesty and of the Siamese government toward
our work.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in this year that our first attempt at establishing
a mountain sanitarium was made. It was designed
to furnish a refuge from the great heat of the
plain, to be a retreat for invalids, and a place where
new missionaries might more safely become acclimatized,
and still be studying the language. But as
a matter of fact, new missionaries are put to work so
promptly that it is about as hard for them to withdraw
from the battle as it is for the older ones. Since
we kept no watchman on the premises, the sanitarium
was afterwards burned down—possibly by forest fires.
Later a better and more convenient situation was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>nearer the city, so near that a man can ride up in the
evening, spend the night there with his family, and return
in the morning to his work for the day. It is in
a delightful situation beside a cool brook, but is too
low for the best results as a health resort.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>At the Annual Meeting in December, the importance
of opening a new station in Lakawn was discussed.
The baptism of the officer from that city, and the
organization of a church there, have already been
mentioned. The officer was constant in his appeals
for the establishment of a station there, with a missionary
in residence. Although Mr. Wilson was soon
to start with his family for the United States on a furlough,
there would still be left in Chiengmai—if I were
sent to Lakawn—two ministers and two physicians,
even if these were but three men in all. Besides, there
were beginning to be some good native assistants in
Chiengmai. No one had expressed a desire to open a
new station, and no one had been sounded in regard
to the matter. So I determined to make now the visit
to Lakawn which I had planned for the previous fall,
but had been unable to accomplish. My wife and our
little son Norwood were to accompany me. When our
preparations were well advanced, what was our delight
to find that Dr. and Mrs. Peoples wished to accompany
us, if they could obtain elephants. When this was
mentioned to Prince Bijit, he not only volunteered the
elephants, but informed us that he had authority from
His Majesty to see that we had a lot for our station
there, and, furthermore, that, in passing through
Lakawn, he had already secured for us one of the most
desirable lots in the place. In addition to this, His
Majesty had sent by him two thousand rupees as a contribution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>toward the new station and a hospital. Who
could fail to see that the guiding hand of the Lord was
in it! Before this I had written to our United States
Consul to get permission to secure a lot there, but had
never once thought of a contribution, much less of one
so liberal. Mrs. McGilvary thus reports our trip in
a letter to our daughter:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Lakawn, January 30th, 1885. We reached Lampūn on
Friday. I curtained off one end of the sālā just north of
the city, and Mrs. Peoples did the same at the other end,
leaving the space between and the veranda for callers.
There we spent the Sabbath. Your father preached twice
to very attentive audiences. We were impressed with the
favourable prospect for mission work, and hope to make a
longer visit to the place soon. We left on Monday, and
reached this place on Thursday noon, and lodged in a public
sālā just opposite the beautiful lot which the Prince has
given us for a station. It is in a fine site, one of the best
in the city. We called on the Chief this morning, and all
seemed pleased at the prospect of having a mission station
here. It is not yet settled who is to open it. We are willing
to come, and so are Dr. and Mrs. Peoples.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>PRESBYTERY, RETURNING FROM MEETING IN LAKAWN</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>As may well be imagined, we returned to Chiengmai
with grateful hearts for the many providences that
had favoured us. The new station was assured. We
had not then thought of keeping two physicians for
Chiengmai. Dr. Cheek had charge of the medical
work. Dr. Peoples, naturally, preferred a field where
he would have ample scope both for his medical profession
and for the itinerating work of which he was
equally fond. His double profession and other qualifications
fitted him as no one else could be fitted
for opening the new station. On my wife’s account I
was very willing to yield him the pleasure—for such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>to me it has always been—of breaking new ground.
Mrs. McGilvary had already had the labour and self-denial
of opening two stations, one of which was a new
mission. The importance of Lakawn as the next station
could not be challenged. Dr. and Mrs. Peoples
themselves were pleased with the place and the prospect
of the new field. So they were unanimously appointed
and set apart to the new and important work.</p>

  <h2 id='ch24' class='c010'>XXIV<br /> <br />STRUGGLE WITH THE POWERS OF DARKNESS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The belief in witchcraft was still prevalent everywhere,
and this year brought us striking illustrations
of its cruel power. An elderly man
with his wife and family, living in one of the outlying
villages, was accused of witchcraft. The pair of elephants
which he owned and used had belonged to a
man suspected of harbouring a malicious spirit; and it
was thought that the demon had followed these elephants
into the family of their new master. The family
was promptly ostracized; but by driving off her
husband with his elephants, the wife might avoid expulsion,
and might save for herself and her daughters
the comfortable home. I endeavoured in vain to prevent
this outcome. “I am much more afraid of the
spirits,” said the wife, “than of bears and tigers.”
The husband could no longer face the universal odium
which he encountered, and so was driven forth. But
the spirits served the old man a good turn—they
drove him into the Christian religion, which he lives to
adorn, and they gave him two good elephants. The
family afterwards applied for one of them. As a matter
of equity he gave up one, and lived comfortably
with a Christian son on the proceeds of the sale of
the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then there was a great epidemic of fever in Bān Pên
in the neighbouring province of Lampūn. Few homes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>were left without sad hearts and vacant places through
the death of one or more members. The destroyer
must be some demon which had taken up its abode in a
human habitation, and was preying on the inhabitants
of the village. The family of one of the most prosperous
men in the village was finally selected as the one
which must be the abode of the destroyer. As they
could hardly decide in which particular member of it
the demon resided, they regarded all with equal suspicion,
and proceeded to wreak their vengeance to the
uttermost upon them all.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, according to the usual custom, anonymous letters
were dropped at the gate, warning the family to
flee, or dire would be the consequences. When threats
failed, armed with an order from the court, the whole
village appeared on the scene and compelled the family
to flee for their lives. No sooner were they out
of the way than their two large teak dwelling-houses,
with rice-bins, outhouses, etc., were torn down and scattered
piecemeal over the lot. Not even a tree or shrub
was left on the place. To gain a breathing-spell, the
family moved into a bamboo shed hastily extemporized
on the banks of the Mê Ping, some two miles distant
from what had been their home. By some accident
they were directed to our mission. They had learned
that the King’s edict protected the Christians, and,
above all, that the Christian religion protected them
from all fear of evil spirits. And so they came to see
if it were true, and if there were any refuge for
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever was to be done for them in the way of
earthly succor, must evidently be done quickly. Their
neighbours in their temporary refuge would doubtless
soon drive them away again. At the earnest entreaty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of the man I took one of the elders, and went down to
look into the case for myself. It was heart-rending.
Whatever they had been able to snatch from the wreck
of a well-to-do home—beds, bedding, furniture, kitchen
utensils—was heaped up in a pile that covered the
whole floor-space of their shack. The great-grandmother,
helpless in her dotage, and the little children,
were lying here and there wherever a smoother spot
could be found. Their case seemed almost hopeless
as far as human aid was concerned. Nān Chaiwana
had himself appealed for aid both to the court and to
the governor, and had been told that there was nothing
they could do for him. The court was committed
against him. The governor, however, was personally
friendly to us, and had shown no ill will towards the
man. It was barely possible that something might
be accomplished there. We all had worship together
amid the confusion of their hut—the first Christian
service they had ever attended. They assured us of
their joyful acceptance of the Gospel, and pledged
obedience to all its teachings. We promised to do
whatever we could in their behalf, and returned home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day Mr. Martin and I went down to Lampūn
to call on the governor. He was not at home, but in
the rice-fields several miles out in the country. We followed
him there. He received us kindly, but said,
“Were I to make proclamation to protect that family,
it would be impossible to enforce it. Nearly everybody
in that neighbourhood believes that the bodies
or ashes of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, or children
are in that graveyard, sent there by the demon in
that family. If you can devise some plan to protect
them, you are welcome to try it; but if they return
to that village, I cannot be responsible for the results.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>When told that they had now renounced the spirits,
and put themselves under the Great Spirit, he said,
“That is all very well, but how am I to convince the
others that <i>they</i> are safe?” We then begged that he
would give the place over to us. We wanted a place
for preaching. We would put up one of the houses
and establish a Christian family in it, with medicine to
cure their fevers. I would oversee it, but would ask
the family to help in the work. To this he readily
consented. We trusted his promise, and we returned
encouraged.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few evenings later I arrived on the scene with our
elder and some other Christians, and pitched tent at
the edge of the ricefield, a hundred yards from the
deserted lot, to engage in a contest with the destroying
demon. It was, moreover, a crucial contest as between
Christianity and demonism. Our whole future
work in that province, and, to a large extent, throughout
the land, depended on the result. Soon curiosity
brought to our tent the head man and a large number
of the villagers. We spent the evening in preaching
to them. When asked what we proposed to do
with the situation, we explained that we had come
to take possession of the house and lot—the governor
had given it over to the mission for a station. It
was now the property of the Christians, over whom the
spirits had no power. It was to be dedicated to the
Lord’s work, and we even asked their aid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning we began work, bringing in some of
the men of the outcast family to assist in identifying
and reassembling the scattered timbers of the house.
With much difficulty bone was joined to bone, and timber
to timber. In a few days some of the villagers offered
to be hired to help. One or two women of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>family came over to cook for the workmen. Before
long one house was set up, roofed, and floored; whereupon
we moved up into it, and invited the neighbours
to attend its dedication that evening. The evening was
spent in song and prayer and praise. Many came up
into the house. More listened from the ground below.
We had given quinine to the fever patients, who were
glad to get well by the help of Christian medicine.
Meanwhile the epidemic subsided, and the worst fears
of the people were allayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it became necessary for me to return to Chiengmai,
I left the elder to furnish moral support to the
poor outcasts, who, little by little, came back to their
home, and became the Christian family which we had
promised to establish there. To save the land from
being utterly lost to him, Nān Chaiwana had mortgaged
it to one of the princes for the trifling sum of
one hundred rupees. Not trusting to the prince’s unselfishness,
I took Nān Chaiwana’s own money, paid the
mortgage, and with some regret the prince released the
property to me. Thus was it all restored to the family.
Mr. Martin and I visited the station as often as
we could. It became an interesting centre for our
work, and ultimately grew into the Bethel church.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>While I was engaged in this work, a strange thing
was doing on the other side of the Mê Ping. One day
a man came in from the “Big Tamarind Tree Village”
to tell us that his whole village had become Christians,
and were building a chapel. When it was finished, he
would invite us to come down and indoctrinate the
people in the teachings of our religion. This was something
new, and, of course, most interesting. In due
time the man came to Chiengmai to inform us that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the chapel was finished, and we were invited to go
down, take possession, dedicate it, and teach the
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the following Friday, Mr. Martin and I took
boat and went to the village landing, where we separated,
he going east to receive and baptize the converts
in the “new home of the teachers,” as the house
at Bān Pên long was called; and I to dedicate the
new chapel at the “Big Tamarind Tree Village.” I
found the chapel there all right, and the whole village
assembled to welcome the teacher; and, apparently,
like the audience that Peter found in the house of
Cornelius, ready “to hear words whereby they might
be saved.” The chapel was built mostly of bamboo,
but so new and neat that I complimented the villagers,
and expressed my great delight. After our reception,
I invited them up into the chapel for worship, and began
by announcing a hymn, and inviting them to join
in learning to sing it; expecting, with my assistant and
other Christians who had accompanied me, to spend
the time in teaching them what Christianity is; presuming
that their reception of it was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>But somehow things did not seem to run smoothly.
I was conscious of being in a wrong atmosphere. The
leader of the movement seemed ill at ease. None entered
in with the accustomed zeal of new converts. My
assistant noticed the same thing, and whispered in
my ear that something was wrong. They were whispering
to him, “Where is the money?” “What
money?” “Why, the fifty or one hundred rupees that
we were told would surely be forthcoming to every
family that aided in the building, and that entered
the new religion. The foreigners are rich, and, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>course, will be delighted to distribute money freely.”
The leader, of course, expected the lion’s share. It
had all been a mere business venture on his part—or,
rather, a swindle! This was on Saturday. On Monday
morning Mr. Martin and I met at the boat according
to agreement, he to report a good day and
the baptism of ten adults along with as many children,
and the reception of a number of catechumens; and I
to confess how I had been sold.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In the summer of 1885 a most interesting work was
started in some villages to the southwest of the city.
Our indefatigable Nān Tā had visited that region, and
many had professed their faith. Mr. Martin and I
both responded to the call, and made a number of visits
there. Two chapels were built by the enquirers, one
at Lawng Kum, and one at Chāng Kam. I quote the
following account of this work from the New York <i>Observer</i>:</p>

<p class='c024'>“June 9th, 1885.—I have just returned from the villages
referred to in my last letter. I found twenty-two families
of professed believers at Lawng Kum Chapel, which with
the aid of a few dollars from elsewhere they had succeeded
in building. Among them are at least six persons
who give good evidence of a change of heart, and the rest
are interesting enquirers. Ten miles from there, at Chāng
Kam, I visited by invitation another company who had renounced
Buddhism, and who call themselves Christians. On
arriving there a roll of thirty-five families was handed me.
Most of them had attended worship at times in the chapel at
Chiengmai, and a few of them are no doubt true Christians.
Here also we secured a native house for a chapel. They
contributed a part of the small sum needed, while in this
case, as in the other, their contribution was supplemented
from the monthly contributions of the church in Chiengmai.
Deputations have been sent also from places still further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>away, representing in one case twenty, and in another case
twelve families enrolled by themselves, with others only
waiting for the arrival of a teacher.</p>

<p class='c027'>“It is probably premature to predict what will be the
result of all this. The simultaneousness of the movement in
villages thirty or forty miles apart is remarkable. It shows
a longing for something they have not. To turn this
awakening to most account, we need more help, both native
and foreign. Mr. Martin enters into the work with all his
zeal, and has contributed no little toward keeping up the
interest.”</p>

<p class='c025'>Our expectations in regard to the work at Lawng
Kum were disappointed mainly by removals of families
to other places. The chapel in Chāng Kam was
burned down by incendiaries, but was soon replaced,
and the village has continued to be one of our most
important out-stations. Its people have recently
[1910] built a new and large chapel, and will soon
be organized into a church. One zealous man in Mê
Āo led first his own family and then his neighbours
into the faith, till they, too, have now a chapel built
of teak, with a band of faithful workers to worship
in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our first visits to these new places were intensely interesting.
It seemed as if the Gospel would be embraced
by whole villages. But the burning of the
chapel tells a tale of a strong adverse influence. Opposition
usually drives off the timid and the merely
curious. The lines, then, are sharply drawn, and the
Christian society really finds itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the last week of the year I spent a few days
at the village of Mê Dawk Dêng to hold a communion
service there, and incidentally to give my family and
the teachers of the Girls’ School a much-needed outing.
It was at the height of the rice-harvest, and, one evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>we all greatly enjoyed the sight of a regular rice-threshing
“bee” at the farm of one of our elders. The
“bee” is always at night. The bundles of rice from
the harvest-field are piled up so as to form a wall five
feet high around a space of some twenty-five feet square,
with an opening for entrance at one corner. In the
centre of this square is a horizontal frame of bamboo
poles, against which the bundles of rice-heads are
forcibly struck. The grain falls to the ground below,
and the straw is tossed outside. In those days the
whole plain at rice-harvest was lighted up by bonfires
of the burning straw—a glorious sight as I have
watched it from Doi Sutēp.</p>

<p class='c009'>We pitched our tent near by to enjoy the scene. The
men and boys do the threshing, while the women and
girls do the cooking for the feast with which the work
ends. The village maidens are always on hand to encourage
their beaux in their work by passing to them
water or betel-nut, and to serve the viands at the feast.
It reminded me much of the husking bees I had seen
as a lad in the South seventy years ago. How near of
kin is all the world!</p>

<p class='c009'>We had a delightful communion service on the Sabbath.
Seven adults and six children were baptized.
On Monday morning we returned home refreshed and
better prepared for the work before us.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>The year had been one of marked progress. The
Girls’ School had been strengthened by the arrival of
Miss Lizzie Westervelt. The new station at Lakawn
had been opened, and Dr. and Mrs. Peoples had been
installed there. More new work had been opened in
the neighbourhood of Chiengmai and Lampūn than in
any one year of the history of the mission. One hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>and two adults were added to the communion roll,
and about as many children were baptized. Our new
“witchcraft-house” at Bān Pên, with its hospitable
family, afforded a comfortable prophet’s chamber for
the missionaries and a chapel for worship. The Bethel
church was afterwards organized in it. That family
became highly respected, and has furnished some of
the most influential members of our church. The work
in Nawng Fān, seven miles south of Chiengmai—Nān
Inta’s village—had steadily grown. It still continues
to be one of our best out-stations, and will, during the
present year [1910] be organized into a church.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>The year 1886 opened auspiciously. But Mr.
Martin had brought malaria in his system from
his old home; and the Lāo country is a better
place for contracting the infection than for eradicating
it. He worked indefatigably, but seldom with a
blood-temperature down to the normal. In January
he accepted an invitation from Mr. Gould, the British
Vice-Consul, to accompany him on a tour of inspection
through the northern provinces, hoping that the change
might prove beneficial. It afforded, moreover, opportunity
for some missionary work in places seldom or
never visited. He was the first to visit the Mūsô villages
high up among the mountains. He baptized a
few converts in Chieng Sên, and reported an interest
there that should be followed up.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this same time Krū Nān Tā—for such, though
not yet ordained, I shall in future call him—returned
from Chieng Rāi with a most encouraging report of
developments there. Later a deputation of seven men,
with Tāo Tēpasing as their leader, came to us from the
village of Mê Kawn in the Chieng Rāi province,
earnestly entreating a visit from the missionary. In
their number was Pū King from Chieng Rāi, who had
been a notorious bandit, robber, and murderer. He
had now submitted to the government, and was given
a place as public executioner and as doer of other jobs
from which only a lawless man would not shrink. Before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>meeting Krū Nān Tā, he had gone so deep in sin
that no hope was left him, and he became hardened in
despair. But his conscience was ill at ease. Hearing
rumours of the Christian religion, he determined that
if it could give him hope of pardon, he would seek it
at any cost. He and his wife walked one hundred and
ten miles to see if it were really true that Jesus could
save even him. Our good friend the governor encouraged
his coming, and said, “If the Christian religion
can make a good man out of Pū King, I shall have
no more doubts of its truth and power.” And we have
no doubt that it did that very thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few days Krū Nān Tā and I returned with the
party. Elder Āi Tū of Chieng Rāi,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c020'><sup>[14]</sup></a> with his family,
accompanied us. We thus had quite a little congregation
to worship nightly about the camp-fire, and
every one of the party was either a Christian or an enquirer.
This was my third trip to the north, and the
first of those annual trips that have made that road so
familiar to me.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f14'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Afterwards Prayā Pakdī.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The little colony of Christians at Wieng Pā Pāo was
prospering. One of them was the man whom his wife
had driven off, elephants and all, for witchcraft. Nān
Tā reported the governor of the place as a believer.
He had ceased to make offerings in temples, and he
ridiculed the idols. He received us most hospitably,
and desired to have a mission station there. Afterwards,
however, through policy and the influence of
a Burmese son-in-law, he resumed his old worship;
though to the last in his heart of hearts, I think, he
believed our teachings to be true. In the case of subordinate
officials, the final step of joining the church
is terribly hard to take.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>At Salī Toi, “Grandma” Pan had been praying day
and night for our coming. She lived some distance
away from the road, and feared that we might pass
her by. She was overjoyed to see us, and we had to
check the homage she offered us. The poor woman was
sadly in need of support. She was the only Christian
in the place, and was surrounded by hostile neighbours
who absolutely rebelled against her establishing herself
in the place. Her family had renounced the spirits,
and therefore her “patriarch,” to whom she could
rightly look for protection, became her chief accuser.
He went to the governor of Chieng Rāi for an order
forbidding her to settle there. But he had his thirty-mile
walk for his trouble. The governor told him that
the family was not to be interfered with. How could
he forbid those whom the King’s edict allowed?</p>

<p class='c009'>Having failed with the governor, they tried to draw
away the daughter-in-law. But she said she would
stick by her husband and his family. Their religion
should be her religion, and their God should be her
God. The villagers then notified the family that it
would be held responsible for the value of any buffalo
or elephant that might die in the village. The theory
was that the demons would take vengeance on the village
for allowing the trespass of an enemy on their
domains. But all their efforts to shake the poor
woman’s faith were futile.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Mê Kawn village, from which the delegation had
chiefly come, of course we were received with a warm
welcome. On the recent visit of Nān Tā, when the
leading supporters of the temple became Christians,
the less religious families also deserted it. I even saw
oxen sheltered from the rain under its roof. A club-footed
man, Noi Tāliya by name, a good scholar in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Ngīo, Burmese, and Lāo, had been the life of the temple.
And it is the earnest Buddhist that makes the
earnest Christian. His son first heard the Gospel, and,
coming home, explained it to his father. Calling his
family together, the father said to them, “There are
the spirit shrines. Any one may have them who
wishes to continue their worship.” No one making a
bid for them, a bonfire was made, and the once valued
treasures all vanished in smoke. When he went to
Chieng Rāi to announce his conversion to the governor
and to the Uparāt, he said that he prayed all
the way that he might answer their questions discreetly
and wisely. He did not know that the governor
had no more confidence in his deserted idols
and spirits than he himself had.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the evening of our arrival, the largest house in
the village was filled to overflowing till late in the
night. Before Sunday the people had extemporized a
chapel which afterwards became the foundation of the
Mê Kawn church. Two Sundays were spent in teaching
these people before we moved on to Chieng Rāi,
leaving the new disciples under the oversight of Noi
Tāliya.</p>

<p class='c009'>On reaching Chieng Rāi we were invited by the governor
to take up our quarters in his old residence,
which we did. It was a better house than his present
one, but there had been two deaths in it, and it was
pronounced unlucky. He knew we were not afraid
of ill luck. On the contrary, it was very good luck
that we got it, for the rains were now falling daily.
The governor and Nān Tā were near relatives and very
intimate friends withal. His interest in us was as
teachers of the only religion that ever afforded him a
ray of hope. But on this trip Pū King, the reformed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>bandit, and his family, were the centre of our interest
there. And it was not long before he, too, like Saul
of Tarsus, became a striking illustration of the grace
of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few hours beyond Chieng Rāi on the road to Chieng
Sên, was the home of Āi Tū. His was the first Christian
family in the province. He had built—in part
that it might furnish a guest-chamber for the missionary
on his visits, and in part that it might serve as
a chapel for worship—the largest house in all that
neighbourhood. When we arrived, he had already vacated
it for us, and had moved his family down into a
shed. A number of families had begun to attend worship,
and to keep the Sabbath; but were frightened
away by that ridiculously stale story that missionaries
were making Christians in order to carry them off in
their ships to feed the Yaks! Strange that such a
palpable absurdity should deceive any one; yet we
have known whole villages to be frightened away by it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Chieng Sên, in the home of Nān Suwan, we were
at once aware of being in a Christian atmosphere—in
a consecrated Christian family. That family was a
city set upon a hill—a leaven in the new city and
province. It alone had given Christianity a good
name. The governor was free to say that if Christianity
made such men as Nān Suwan, he would like
to see the whole country Christian. The influence of
the Girls’ School in Chiengmai was strongly reflected in
his daughter, Kuī Kêo. She taught no regular school
other than her Sunday School; but from time to time
during the week she taught the neighbours. Young
men who began by trying to ridicule her out of her
religion, now treated her with the greatest respect.
We were told that rude young fellows singing vulgar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>songs would lower their voices when passing by the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>We crossed the river in a small boat to spend a few
days in teaching four new families of Christians on
the eastern side. One of the men was Tāo Rāt, the
village officer, and another was his son, Noi Chai. The
latter became an influential ruling elder, and, like Nān
Suwan, one of the pillars of the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Chieng Sên we crossed the broad prairie-like
plain westward to Bān Tam. The officer of the village
was Sên Yā Wichai—mentioned in the early part of
this narrative as the very first believer in Chiengmai.
The journey was one of the worst for elephants that
I ever made. Heavy rains had soaked the ground so
that at every step it seemed almost impossible for
them to pull their huge feet out of their tracks. The
Sên lived only a quarter of a mile from a remarkable
feature of the mountain ridge. The Mê Tam, the
largest river in the plain, flows bodily out from under
the mountain, much as does one of the sources of the
Mê Ping at Chieng Dāo.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a great pleasure to spend a Sunday with our
now venerable Christian and his family. It was a family
of officers, his three sons all being either of the
grade of Tāo or of Sên—which shows the esteem in
which the family was held. But, unfortunately, their
official position made it more difficult for the sons to
follow the example of their father.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Sunday night the rain came down in torrents,
reminding us that it was better for us to be at home.
We started homeward early the next morning. Our
route skirted the beautiful mountain range, crossing
brooks and the larger streams of the Mê Tam and the
Mê Chan. Already the road had become almost impassable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>except for elephants and natives unencumbered
with shoes or trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have already spoken of the great mortality incurred
in the attempt to people these new Lāo states.
Occasionally the straggling remnant of a family might
be seen returning. One poor little boy awakened my
deepest sympathy. All of his family had died except
himself and his brother, a monk, who were trying to
save themselves by flight back to their old home in
the province of Chiengmai. After I passed them I
began to wonder whether the pale, weary-faced, and exhausted
travellers would ever reach the rest they
sought. Then I began to think that here I was enacting
again the old tale of the priest and the Levite
who passed by on the other side. At last I could stand
it no longer. I stopped and waited for them to come
up. I offered the pitiful little skeleton of a boy a seat
with me on the back of the elephant. At first he somewhat
distrusted my motive, wondering what I wanted
to do with him; but he was too weary to refuse. When
he revived, he proved to be a veritable little chatterbox,
and good company. I kept him nearly a week, till we
entered the Chiengmai plain at Doi Saket. Only four
years ago, eleven children out of five Christian families
who had settled in Wieng Pā Pāo, died during
the first year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Returning through Chieng Rāi, we revisited the new
families of Christians in that province. In the city the
governor’s wife asked us to have worship in their
new house, to which they reverently listened. When
we ended she said, “Why, they pray for everybody!”
Pū King, the executioner, was holding on with a death-grip
to the hope of salvation for the chief of sinners.
The case of the apostle himself, and of the penitent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>thief, greatly encouraged him. Nān Tā also was
greatly rejoiced that his brother Sên Kat became a
believer on this tour.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my return I found Mr. Martin but little, if at all,
improved, by his trip. He was so thoroughly discouraged
that he felt that he could not face another hot
season. He remained with us till the end of the rainy
season, and then, with his family, left Siam for the
United States. I never had felt so thoroughly crushed
as I was at his departure. During three whole years
we had lived in the same house, and worked together
hand in hand in the evangelistic work, of which he was
very fond.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cheek already had severed his official connection
with the mission, and had gone into business of his
own. But he kindly gave his professional service to
the missionaries, and was ready to perform pressing
surgical operations for the natives who came to the
hospital.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I have often wondered whether all foreign missions,
have as many and as rapid alternations of sunshine
and shadow, as the Lāo mission. Our medical work
was once more at a standstill; and by the departure
of Mr. Martin, the evangelistic work again was crippled.
But at Hong Kong Mr. Martin met Rev. and
Mrs. D. G. Collins, Dr. and Mrs. A. M. Cary, and Rev.
W. C. Dodd, on their way out for the Lāo mission, with
Rev. W. G. McClure for Lower Siam. Mrs. Cary had
become so exhausted by continual sea-sickness during
the whole voyage, that, on her arrival in Bangkok,
many thought her unable to endure the long river
trip of six or seven weeks. Mr. McClure offered to
exchange fields with the Carys; but Mrs. Cary, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>true pluck, said that she had been appointed to the
Lāo mission, and to the Lāo she would go. But, alas!
it was to be otherwise. She became worse soon after
leaving Bangkok. On Sunday, January 16th, 1887, a
mile above Rahêng, she became unconscious, and
shortly after gently passed into her everlasting rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still a month’s journey to their destination.
There was nothing to be done but to lay the body
to rest in the grounds of a monastery. Who can portray
that parting scene, or adequately sympathize with
the bereaved husband and sister (Mrs. Collins), or with
the other members of the party, as they performed the
last sad offices, and then resumed their lonesome journey!</p>

<p class='c009'>When the party reached Chiengmai on the 17th of
February, they found there only the McGilvarys, Miss
Griffin, and Miss Westervelt. Miss Cole had gone to
Bangkok. But the Girls’ School was flourishing under
the direction of the two ladies last mentioned.
Former pupils of the school were then doing good
service in three different provinces as teachers. But
the arrival of the new forces made possible for the first
time a Boys’ High School. Circumstances now were
much more favourable than they were when Mr. Wilson
made the attempt in the earlier days of the mission.
We now had Christian patrons, and there was a
growing desire in the land for education. Buddhist
pupils were willing and anxious to attend our school.
Mr. Collins preferred the educational work. As soon
as he acquired the language sufficiently well, he was
put in charge of the school for boys, and it was soon
crowded with pupils.</p>

<p>GIRLS’ SCHOOL IN CHIENGMAI<br />1892</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Mr. Dodd’s preference was along the line of a Training
School for Christian workers. Happily, the taste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and preference of both these men were along the lines
of greatest need. Meanwhile Mr. Dodd entered into
the evangelistic work also with a zeal that has never
abated. As newcomers see things with different eyes,
it is always interesting to get their first impressions.
Mr. Dodd’s first experience is thus given in a letter
to the Board of June 9th, 1887:</p>

<p class='c024'>“On Friday, June 3d, Rev. D. McGilvary of the Lāo mission
left Chiengmai by boat for a tour southward, taking
attendants and all necessary equipments, accompanied by a
raw recruit, and three efficient native helpers. We arrived
at our first station about the middle of the afternoon, and
before bed-time held religious conversation with as many enquirers
as time would permit. Our audience chamber was
the house of one of our newly-received members. Our ‘outward
and ordinary means’ of attracting an audience was a
watch, two mariner’s compasses, a magnifying glass, a stereoscope
with an assortment of views, and a violin. The raw
recruit played the violin, and thus called the audience together.
We used both the other attractions to hold them
and to gain their confidence and interest; and afterwards
Dr. McGilvary easily and naturally drew them into religious
conversation. Soon the conversation became a monologue
of instruction in the religion of the great God. The violin
was no longer needed to arouse or sustain an interest.
Every day, and late into the evening, the Doctor and the
three assistants conversed; sometimes to quite an audience,
sometimes to individual enquirers.</p>

<p class='c027'>“The religious attitude of the people was a revelation to
the newly-arrived missionary, and doubtless would be to
most of God’s people in the United States. Nearly all of
these people had heard of the ‘religion of the great God,’
but knew nothing about it, since the district had never before
been visited by a missionary.... But their receptivity
was marvellous.... Without exception these
Buddhists confessed at the outset, or were soon brought
to concede, the immeasurable superiority of Christianity.
Many said, ‘It is of no use to argue. Your books tell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>beginnings of things; ours do not.’ On one occasion when
Dr. McGilvary had finished reading and explaining the first
chapter of Genesis, one of his auditors remarked to his fellows,
‘There is more real information on that one page than
in all Buddha’s writings.’ The sense of sin is universal, so
too is the insufficiency of the works of merit. Many sad
souls confessed that they had long been dreading the penalty
for sins for which they feared that ‘merit-making’ could not
atone.</p>

<p class='c027'>“The results we cannot measure. We were absent two
weeks. Religious service or conversations were held in more
than twenty different homes, and in some of these several
times. Audiences varied from a single enquirer to fifty.
Thus hundreds heard the gospel for the first time. Many
who seemed above the suspicion of hypocrisy professed to
believe and accept what they heard.... One principal
reason for this tour just now, was to baptize in his own
home and among his subjects the chief officer of the district.
Himself, his wife, and his whole family were baptized—a
most interesting household. The abbot of one village monastery
professes to accept Christianity. For some time he
has been sending his parishioners, including his own sister,
for instruction. There is another district officer of the
same rank as our newly-baptized convert, a constant visitor
and deeply interested. This is a specimen tour, neither better
nor worse than the average taken these days. For the
last two years, although most of the time there have been
but two ordained missionaries in the field, over ninety ascessions
have been made to the First Church.”—<i>Church at
Home and Abroad</i>, May, 1888.</p>

<p class='c025'>Before the short trip reported by Mr. Dodd, I had
taken a longer one to the northern provinces, going
over the same ground which Mr. Martin and I had
travelled the season before. This time I baptized thirty-six
adults and thirty-two non-communing members.
The communion was administered eight times. I married
two couples and ordained one elder. Each Sunday
was spent in villages where there were already Christians.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>This encouraging success was the harvest of
seed sown on former tours, but gathered largely
through God’s blessing on the work of faithful elders.
Both in Chieng Rāi and in Chieng Sên we might then
have organized churches with a goodly number of
members communing and non-communing, and with
very good material for officers. Nān Suwan at Chieng
Sên, like myself, never had the gift of fluent speech,
but his reputation for sterling integrity has left a
mark that eloquence might envy. And Āi Tū at Nāng
Lê bids fair to be another power in the province of
Chieng Rāi. Both of them are strongly aided by their
daughters, the first-fruits of our Girls’ School.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the year 1887 the whole number of adult accessions
was one hundred and seven; and one hundred
and eleven non-communing members were added
to the roll, making two hundred and eighteen additions
to our little flock, exclusive of Lakawn. As I
now look back over these years, it is plain to me that
the great lack of the mission all the way through has
been the lack of well-trained native helpers; and
for this lack the mission itself is largely to blame.
Those who are eager to accomplish the evangelization
of the world within the present generation, should first
of all lay hold of the present generation of Christians
in every mission field. Fill <i>these</i> with enthusiasm,
qualify them, and send them forth, and we have a
lever that will lift the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Report of the Board in the same number
of <i>The Church at Home and Abroad</i> cited above, we
quote the following:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Dr. and Mrs. Peoples are still left alone in Lakawn, the
utmost picket of the foreign missionary line. Mrs. Peoples
has not one lady for a companion; and the doctor is dangerously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>burdened, bearing all alone the labour of teaching
and healing. For more than two years they have been
waiting for help. No station under the care of the Foreign
Board calls so loudly for reinforcements as this. Again
and again we thought we had found a Christian couple for
Lakawn; but in each case we have been disappointed. Single
men could have been sent, but it is very much to be desired
that the new missionary going there should be married.
Dr. Peoples’ medical work has won for him increasing
friendliness throughout the city.... Mrs. McGilvary has
revised the Lāo version of Matthew’s Gospel, and has translated
for the first time about half of the book of Acts.
The Scriptures have had considerable circulation among the
Lāo, but only in the Siamese tongue.... Dr. Cary had
no sooner reached the field than through the assistance of
Dr. McGilvary and Norwood McGilvary, a young lad, acting
as interpreters, he was able to begin work with regular
hours for receiving patients, and for surgical practice.... Mr.
Collins has made a beginning in the much-needed
school for boys.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Only one other mission now under the care of our
Presbyterian Church has during the last year shown as much
growth, in proportion to the missionary force employed, as
the Lāo mission.... It is never out of place to remind our
Presbyterian Church that it is to her alone that God has
committed the evangelization of the Lāo tribes.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c010'>XXVI<br /> <br />A FOOTHOLD IN LAMPŪN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>At a meeting of the Presbytery shortly before the
opening of the year 1888, a committee consisting
of Dr. Peoples, Mr. Dodd, and myself, was
appointed to organize two churches, one in Chieng Sên
and one in Chieng Rāi, if the way were found open
to do so. We also arranged that Mrs. McGilvary
should accompany our son Norwood as far as Bangkok
on his way to the United States. And both expeditions
were to start on the same day, Monday,
February 7th.</p>

<p class='c009'>To ease somewhat the strain of such a parting, I
took an earlier leave, and went on Saturday with Mr.
Dodd to spend Sunday with the church at Mê Dawk
Dêng. That evening we performed a marriage ceremony
in the church. The next day thirteen adults were
received into the church—nine by baptism and four
who were children of the church. On Monday Mrs. McGilvary
and I exchanged our last good-byes by note,
and both parties got off on Tuesday morning. Dr. and
Mrs. Peoples, starting from Lakawn, made the first
stage of their journey separately from us to a rendezvous
at the Christian village of Mê Kawn, twelve
miles south of Chieng Rāi.</p>

<p class='c009'>At our next Christian village another wedding was
waiting for us, but the course of true love did not run
smooth. The bride belonged to a well-to-do Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>family; but no member of it could read the Scriptures.
They, therefore, “redeemed” a Christian family for
four hundred rupees, in order to secure the services of
the son as a sort of Levite in the family, and to teach
the eldest daughter to read. Naturally, the two young
people fell in love with each other. That was a contingency
the mother had not planned for, and a difficulty
arose. She asked, “If I take Nān —— for a
son-in-law, where do my four hundred rupees come in?”
It was all in vain to tell her that she got her pay in
a good son-in-law. She said he was hers already till
his debt was paid. At last she so far relented as to allow
the ceremony to take place, but she would not see
it performed. We invited the father and the rest of
the family and the neighbours into our tent, where,
to their great joy, the two were made man and wife.
The implacable mother lived to see that she had not
made a bad bargain, after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Mê Kawn we were joined by Dr. and Mrs. Peoples,
and we had a good Sabbath with the little flock
there. Our club-footed man had looked after it well,
and he became later a good elder and a fine disciplinarian.
About this time I was taken with a severe attack
of indigestion, from which I did not recover for
many months—the only continued sickness from which
I have suffered in all my connection with the Lāo
mission.</p>

<p class='c009'>On reaching Chieng Rāi, we found our good friend
the governor mourning the death of his wife, the same
who, when we last saw her, invited us to worship in
her house. It was a pleasure to point the bereaved
man to the divine Comforter, and we are fain to believe
that our words were not in vain. He was still
anxious to have the mission station established, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>we, unfortunately, could not yet promise. The Chao
Uparāt invited Dr. Peoples to lecture with his magic
lantern, and to have worship in his residence, where we
had a crowded audience. We did not organize a
church in Chieng Rāi, however, partly because the two
Christian villages, equidistant from the city north
and south, could not agree on the best place of meeting.
But we found the way open in Chieng Sên, and
did organize a church there, in Nān Suwan’s house,
on the very bank of the Mê Kōng, and with one-half of
its members living on the other shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Peoples had left a large practice in Lakawn, and
was obliged to return. Mr. Dodd returned with them
to Lakawn, and thence to Chiengmai. I had come untrammelled,
to remain as long as duty called. It seemed
very desirable to follow up the impressions already
made on that community. But I was not well, and a
week’s delay found me no better. Thinking that a
change might be beneficial, I crossed the plain to Sên
Yā Wichai’s home at the foot of the mountains. It
was a hard day’s ride, and I became worse on the way.
On reaching my destination I could hardly stand.
Resting there on my back a few days without improvement,
it seemed my first duty to get to a physician as
soon as possible, or, at least, make the effort to do so.
Most of the way I could stop at night either with or
near Christian families. This I did, and so reached
Chiengmai on April 14th.</p>

<p class='c009'>During my absence the building of the Boys’ High
School was completed; and the school was opened under
the direction of Mr. Collins on March 19th, with an enrollment
of forty-five boys, nearly all children of Christian
parents. In June Dr. Wilson reached Chiengmai
on his return from the United States; and with him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>came Miss Fleeson, destined with the Doctor to join the
Peoples at Lakawn, and Miss Belle Eakin (now Mrs.
Dodd), for the Girls’ School in Chiengmai. Miss Griffin
was already gone on her furlough.</p>

<p class='c009'>The building for the Girls’ School had long been
in process of construction. Builders and plans had
been several times changed, till at last Dr. Cheek took
the contract, and finished it in the summer of 1888. It
has served its purpose admirably these many years, and
we then thought it would do for all time. But though
the lot then seemed amply large, it proves now entirely
too small for the needs of the school. Moreover, it is
impossible to enlarge it. On its south side runs the
most travelled road in the country; while on the east
the land is owned by a wealthy official, who would not
sell at any price.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our congregations had grown till a church building
became a necessity even more urgent than, a schoolhouse.
The first mission dwelling-house was planned
in part with reference to such need, its largest room
long being used for Sunday worship. Then a small
temporary chapel took its place. After that a larger
teak double dwelling was bought. That, however,
would not hold more than two hundred persons—not
more than half of our largest congregations at the
present day. Then for a time we worshipped in the
unfinished building for the Girls’ School. When, at
last, that was finished, it was needed for its original
purpose, and we again must move. It was then decided
that we must have a church, and one worthy of
our cause—such as would attract rather than repel
both rulers and people. So one Sunday afternoon we
held a meeting of the congregation to take steps for
building it. We were delighted to see the interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>manifested in the enterprise. Pā Kawng, an aged
slave of the Prince, laid down a silver rupee, which
was all the money she possessed—and it was the very
first money received toward the building. The church
was completed by the end of this year.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had continued evidence of the friendship of
Prince Intanon, and even of his growing interest in
our work. One Sunday, in answer to an invitation
given by Mrs. Cheek, he attended our communion
service, conducted that day by Mr. Wilson. Although
he arrived an hour and a half too soon, he remained
all through the long service, and bowed as he took
his leave, just when the communion cups were about
to be passed. On the day of our daughter’s marriage
in Statesville, North Carolina, he and the High Commissioner
attended a reception given in honour of the
event. The Prince had known her as a child, and
seemed much interested. “Is it this very night that
the marriage takes place?” he asked. The reception
was a very pleasant affair. Though my wife was still
in Bangkok, Miss Fleeson and Miss Eakin entered with
all their hearts into the thing, and, with the assistance
of Mr. Dodd and Mr. Collins, carried it through in
splendid shape. After refreshments we had charades
and other games. It was amusing to see the look of
surprise on the face of the Prince when the charades
were played.—“What are they doing?” “What does
that mean?” “I don’t understand.” But the game
was quite too recondite to be explained to him. So,
after the first charade, His Highness and his party took
their leave, assuring us that they had enjoyed the evening
very much.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Wilson and Miss Fleeson presently journeyed on
to their post at Lakawn. The governor there gave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>mission a very desirable plot of ground for the new
buildings which would be required, saying, “I am glad
to have you come. It would be a shame, when you
come to live in our country, if the government did not
do something to make you comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely less important than the opening of the
new station in Lakawn, was the opening of permanent
work in Lampūn, the largest and most important sub-station
of Chiengmai. Lampūn is a little gem of a
walled city in the same great plain as Chiengmai, and
only eighteen miles distant to the south. From the
first settlement of the country, however, it has been
a separate state, yet governed by a branch of the same
ruling race.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have seen that the new governor of Lampūn was
friendly to the mission and the missionaries. The
opening of the work in Bān Pên and other important
villages near it, rendered it almost essential to have a
footing in Lampūn itself. After some negotiation we
secured a suitable lot, the grounds of the second governor
recently deceased. We purchased from the family
the land with the old residence and the stockade.
But presently the family became alarmed lest they had
been too hasty in selling it to foreigners, and brought
back the money, begging us to restore the land. They
brought, also, a message from the governor, saying that
he wanted the residence and the stockade himself, but
would <i>give</i> us the rest of the land. It was to our interest
to keep on good terms with him, and we agreed
to the arrangement. We got what we wanted, a good
station, and we retained, and probably increased the
governor’s friendship.</p>

<div id='i294'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i294.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>REV. JONATHAN WILSON, D.D.<br />1898</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>To make possession sure, I purchased a newly-built
house which had come to be regarded as unlucky, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the owner’s wife had suddenly died in it. Having
arranged to have the house moved and set up on
the lot, I was about to return to Chiengmai, thinking
that there was nothing more to do, when I was sent
for by the chief executive officer of the Court. He said
that the governor, indeed, had given us the place, but
the Court wished to make one proviso. He begged that
I would sign a paper promising in few words that if
the government at any time should need it, we would
give it up. The governor was growing old, and they
themselves would be held responsible. I saw at once
that such a step would put it in the power of any one
to oust us. A need might be feigned, and yet we should
be powerless to withstand it. I was perfectly dumfounded.
My first thought was to go directly to the
governor. But presently I bethought me of the terms
on which H. R. H. Prince Bijit, the brother of His
Majesty, had given to the mission the fine lot for its
hospital. The lot was given in perpetuity on condition
that it be used for medical and missionary purposes
only. As long as it was so used, it was ours.
But it could not be sold, or used for other purposes,
without forfeiture to the Prince. The thought came to
me as an inspiration. I told the officer of that written
deed. “Very well,” said he. “If you have such a
paper as that, show it to me, and I will give you one
like it for this lot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The difficulty was solved. A swift footman was
despatched to Chiengmai asking Mr. Martin to send me
at once a copy of the Prince’s deed of gift. Next morning
it came, and I took it immediately to the Court.
The officer’s surprise was evident. He took it and
read it carefully through. His word was given. After
a moment’s thought he said, “That is all right. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>will relieve me of all responsibility.” Then he called
up his clerk to copy its terms and execute the new
deed. The land was ours to use as long as we should
use it for the purposes specified; and that I hoped
would be until the millennium! With a light heart I
was soon aboard my boat and homeward bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the house had been removed and set up on the
lot, Mr. Collins and I went down and spent a week
there, with interested audiences every night. It at
once became an important out-station of the Chiengmai
mission. In the meantime Mr. Dodd had already collected
some twenty students for his training-class, but
without any quarters for them in Chiengmai. Later
Mr. and Mrs. Dodd were put in charge of the station,
and the Training School was moved over to Lampūn.
When the Lampūn church was organized, its charter
members numbered nearly two hundred. It is now
the mother of two other churches. Scarcity of men in
the mission, openings in other places, and other causes
have prevented the Lampūn station from being continuously
manned. But now, with such efficient workers
there as Mr. and Mrs. Freeman, it has an important
future before it, as a sub-station of Chiengmai.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile my own sickness had continued, with
several relapses. A minor surgical operation had so
delayed my recovery that Dr. Cary now advised a
change and rest in a boat trip to Bangkok. After the
departure of our son to the United States, my wife
had remained in Bangkok for a visit, and was soon to
return. The telegraph line which the Siamese government
had recently completed, enabled me to wire to
her to wait for me to come and bring her back. Dr.
Cary himself, who had never recovered from the shock
occasioned by the tragic death of Mrs. Cary, and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>was never well during his whole stay in the mission, decided
to accompany me as far as Rahêng.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Pāknam Pō I left my boat, and took passage for
Bangkok by river steamer, thus saving seven days.
After remaining in Bangkok only three nights, my
wife and I took passage in the same steamer on her
return trip, and rejoined our boat at the forks. The
water was at its best stage, and we passed up some of
the rapids without knowing that they were there. But
my trouble had not left me. A low diet and long illness
had left me thin and weak. The round trip occupied
only two months. Our last Sunday was at Pāk
Bawng, two days below Chiengmai. There we held a
communion service with the Christian families, and a
new family was baptized.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three miles to the east is Bān Pên, the village which
has figured in a previous chapter. The Christians
there had long been asking for a visit, which my own
sickness and want of time on the part of others rendered
it impossible to make. On Monday morning I
decided to take the risk and visit it. With some misgivings
I saw my wife’s boat move off and leave me—burning,
so to speak, my bridges behind me. The
whole country was flooded. Discarding shoes and
stockings, I made my way on foot, weak as I was,
through water, across ditches, or along the narrow
ridges of rice-fields, and finally reached Bān Pên in
safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>And what a week I spent in that neighbourhood!
At Nawng Sīu, a village two miles distant from Bān
Pên, there were six families of professed believers
whom Dr. Dodd and I had visited the season before—almost
swimming at times to reach them in their scattered
homes. Their admission was postponed at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>time until they should have had further instruction.
To these I specially addressed myself. During the
week our faithful elder, Nān Tā, came down to assist
me in the work. On Friday evening the session met
at Nawng Sīu to examine and instruct these new
converts, and again on Saturday morning, closing
finally at two o’clock in the afternoon with baptism
and the Lord’s Supper. On counting up the numbers,
it was found that twenty adults and seventeen children
had been baptized. Among them was an aged
couple with their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
It was a memorable sight. The Sabbath
was spent at Bān Pên, where seven more adults
and one child were baptized. On Monday I made my
way back to the boat as I had come, and reached home
on Tuesday. And now for the strange part of the
story. <i>I reached home well.</i> My week’s wading in the
water, and the hard work, had done what medicine and
doctors and a long boat trip had failed to accomplish!</p>

<p class='c009'>But a new disappointment awaited me. Before I
reached home, Dr. Cary had resigned. His short
career is one of the mysteries to be explained in the
great beyond. A consecrated physician, he had given
his life to the Lāo people. Crushed by his tragic bereavement
on the way out, and with a constitution
never strong, he contended manfully for two years
against the debilitating effects of a malarial climate.
But at last he had to give up the fight. His work had
been successful. “He saved others; himself he could
not save!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His departure threw on me again the oversight of
the medical work. But this time most of the dispensing
of medicine to the natives fell on Chanta, a protégé
of my own, who had had good training under two physicians.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Meanwhile Dr. Cheek looked after the mission
families, and, as already stated, was always ready to
respond to an urgent call in the hospital. My time
was largely given, therefore, to the evangelistic work,
to instructing Nān Tā and other elders, and to teaching
enquirers and others to read in Siamese, first the
Shorter Catechism, and then a Gospel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The growth of the Chiengmai church, though not
phenomenal, was very healthy and very uniform
throughout the year. There were accessions every
month save one, amounting in all to one hundred and
sixty souls. At the end of the year Miss I. A. Griffin
returned from furlough, and served a very useful term
until 1896, when she retired greatly missed. At
Lakawn, Rev. Hugh Taylor and his wife began a
twenty years’ course of evangelistic work carried on
with indefatigable zeal, while Miss Fleeson was no less
zealous and successful in laying the foundation of a
Girls’ School, destined to be a power in that province.</p>

  <h2 id='ch27' class='c010'>XXVII<br /> <br />A PRISONER OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>We have had frequent occasion gratefully to
record the good will of the Siamese government,
and of its commissioners and representatives,
towards our mission. In all its history the
only exception to this uniform friendliness was in the
case of the Commissioner who, in 1889, succeeded
Prayā Tēp Worachun. The Boys’ School was on an
old deserted monastery-site given by the Prince to Dr.
Peoples for a medical or a mission compound. An
old ruined chēdi or pagoda was still standing on it.
Such lots, deserted by the monks, were then regarded
as abodes of the spirits, and on such the natives dared
not live. In preparing for the school buildings, the
débris about the foot of the chēdi had been dug
away. One of the early acts of the new Commissioner
was to send a written notice to the mission that it was
improper to use old Buddhist shrines for purposes
other than those for which they were originally built;
and he gave us notice that we were to have three months
in which to find other quarters. But as no other lot
was offered in its place, we remained quiet, and that
was the last we heard of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another incident, occurring soon after, was more
serious, and gave us a great deal of anxiety; for it
came near costing the life of one of our best native
assistants. A deputation from some twelve or fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>families in Chieng Dāo came to us with a request that
a native assistant be sent up to teach them. Krū Nān
Tā went up, and they became believers, but required
much further instruction. We selected Noi Siri, the
most prudent of our elders, for the task. We charged
him specially, inasmuch as it was in a province new
to our work, to use great caution and give no just
cause of offence to the rulers or to others. He remained
there a month, and then was recalled by the
illness of his wife. He stopped at the mission to report
progress, giving a good account of the conduct and
diligence of the new Christians.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great was our surprise, then, in a few hours to learn
that Noi Siri had been arrested, put in heavy irons,
and thrown into prison on a charge of treason against
the government. Mr. Collins, Mr. Dodd, and I called
upon the Commissioner to enquire the cause of his arrest.
The Commissioner replied, Yes; he had him arrested
on the grave charge of disloyalty in teaching
the converts that they were exempt from government
work. Such teaching was treason; and if the charge
were true, the penalty was death. It was not, therefore,
a bailable offence. At the same time, he said, no
specifications had been forwarded. He would summon
the accusers, and the man should have a fair trial,
and should have the privilege of producing any witnesses
he pleased in his defence. That was, of course,
all that we could ask, save to beg that the trial be
hastened as far as possible—to which he consented.
Krū Nān Tā was allowed to see the prisoner in his
cell. From him he learned that so far was the accusation
from being true, that he had taught the Christians
that they were <i>not</i> exempt from government work; and
that, furthermore, no call had been made on them for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>service while he was there. We sent immediately for
all the Christian men to come down.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some delay the prisoner was called into court
and examined. According to Siamese custom, his examination
was taken down in writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you Noi Siri, who has been teaching in Chieng
Dāo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you go there to teach?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the fourth of the third waning moon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you taught that Christians are exempt from
public service?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. On the contrary, I taught that, as Siamese
subjects, Christians are to pay their taxes and perform
all the duties of other subjects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The testimony of the governor of Chieng Dāo, his
accuser, was then taken in his presence. Among the
questions asked him were these:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you state any particular time and place when
the Christians were called to do government work and
refused?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I called a man or two, and they did not
obey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When was that call made?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the fourth day of the third waxing moon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the only specification which the governor
gave. The date, it will be noted, was fifteen days
earlier than that of Noi Siri’s arrival in Chieng Dāo.
If the statement were true, it might have subjected
the persons who were summoned to trial and punishment
for disloyalty; but it absolutely cleared Noi Siri.
An upright judge would have dismissed the case. The
Christian witnesses were in attendance to testify as
to the nature of the instruction they received; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>were not given the opportunity to do so. The accused
man was remanded to prison. We waited, but nothing
was done. We called once more on the Commissioner;
but were told that the case had been referred to
Bangkok, and he must wait for a reply. We waited
again. At last we made a written appeal on his behalf,
and in answer were told that the case was one
with their own subjects, and we had nothing to do with
it. Meantime Noi Siri had become quite ill, and all
that we could do was to get him transferred from his
dungeon to the common prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eight months after this, when Mr. Dodd went down
to Bangkok to be married to Miss Eakin, he made,
through the United States Minister, an appeal to the
Prince Minister of the North, who promised an immediate
order for his release. As soon as we were assured
of that, we went to the resident Prince in Chiengmai,
H. R. H. Prince Sonapandit, who promised that
the order should be issued at once. The next day we
called on the Commissioner to remind him of the
Prince’s promise; but he and the Judge had just gone
out for a stroll in the city. It was then Saturday
afternoon. Next day was our communion service, and
I was determined to have Noi Siri present. To do this
I had to follow those men up at once. I was a fast
walker, and, when necessary, could run. My race
after them was the ludicrous sequel of the case. Two
high officials closing their office and escaping, in order
to keep their victim in chains another night, pursued
by swifter feet, and overtaken in the street! The
Judge acknowledged that the Prince had given the
order. He would attend to it to-morrow. Since to-morrow
would be Sunday, I need not come. But I
knew that we should not see Noi Siri in time for our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>worship unless I went for him. So on Sunday morning
I called once more on the Judge, who again said
that I need not wait; but I had to tell him that I
would not return till I saw his release. So the prisoner
was called, and I saw the fetters taken off from
his ankles.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second bell was ringing when I entered the
church; but Noi Siri was with me. The congregation
rose and sang the long metre doxology. There were
not many dry eyes in the room. Mr. Dodd preached
from the text, “And we know that all things work
together for good to them that love God.” Among the
converts who then stood up to make a public profession
of faith was Nāng Su, a daughter of Noi Siri—and
this happy coincidence was no planning of
ours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Noi Siri’s faith had been tried by fire, and he had
come forth from the furnace as pure gold. In addition
to his own imprisonment and distress, his wife had
been for months very low with sickness, and one of his
grandchildren had died during the interval. But from
his prison cell he had written to his family not to
let their faith be shaken either by his trials or by
their own. During the eight months and ten days of
his imprisonment, one hundred and thirty-three persons—his
daughter closing the list—were received into
church-membership. A European in employ of the
government, who had cognizance of the whole case,
afterwards said to me, “It might be well to get the
Commissioner to imprison a few more Christians!” A
history of the case was afterwards published by our
Board in a leaflet entitled, “The Laos Prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the close of the year there was an event which
for the time came near to overthrowing the government.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>A new tax, levied chiefly on areca trees, caused much
exasperation throughout the country. As usual, the
tax was farmed out to Chinese for collection. The
local officers in various districts formed a coalition to
resist to the uttermost the collection of the tax. Of
course, this could not be allowed, since the collectors
were the agents of the government. The resistance was
centred chiefly in the districts to the eastward of
the city, where Prayā Pāp, who had some reputation
as a soldier, went so far as to gather a considerable
force of the insurgents within a few miles of Chiengmai.
A day even was set for their attack on the city.
If they had made a dash then, they could easily
have taken it, for the sympathy of the people was
wholly with them, and the government was unprepared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our house was only two hundred yards away from
the Chinese distillery, which was the objective of the
insurgents. The residence of the Commissioner and
that of the Siamese Prince Sonapandit were nearly opposite
us on the other side of the river. Our position
was further compromised by the fact that the wives
and children of a number of influential Chinese had
almost forcibly taken refuge in our compound. In
any case, we should have been in a position of great
danger from the guns on the other side of the river
aimed at the distillery. We were strongly advised
to take refuge in the British Consulate, whose shelter
was kindly offered us. But the whole population in
our neighbourhood was watching us. If we stirred,
there would have been a general stampede.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately for themselves and for the country, the
courage of the common people failed. One after another
they deserted the leader, till at last he also fled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>He was caught, however, and with seven other leaders
was executed. This was the end of the matter in
Chiengmai; but certain parties of the insurgents, escaping
northwards, became roving bands of marauders
that for some time disturbed the peace of the frontier
towns. The rebellion never had any chance of ultimate
success; but had the attack on the city been actually
made, the immediate consequences would have been
direful, and untold calamity would have been entailed
on the whole country.</p>

<p class='c009'>The arrival of Dr. McKean at the close of the year
marked an era in our medical work. He was accompanied
by our daughter, Miss Cornelia H. McGilvary,
now Mrs. William Harris Jun. It was the pleasant
duty of Mrs. McGilvary to escort the party up from
Bangkok. The appointment of our daughter was no
less a surprise than a delight to us. During her school
days she always said that she would not become a
missionary. When the question came up for final settlement,
she fought it out in her own mind alone,
and reached her own decision. The Lāo language,
which, during her ten years’ absence, she seemed to
have lost entirely, came back to her very soon and with
little effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been Dr. McKean’s privilege to continue the
work begun by able physicians, and to carry it to a
higher degree of efficiency. He has combined, as most
of our physicians have done, the two great objects of
the medical missionary, the medical and the evangelistic,
making the former a means to the latter. While
the professional and the charitable features of the work
have not been minimized, but rather magnified, no minister
has more loved to preach the Gospel, or has been
more successful in it. At the same time it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>that the great work now enlisting his sympathy and
his strenuous efforts—the establishment of a leper colony
and hospital, and the amelioration of the condition
of that unfortunate class—may be the one with
which his name will be most intimately associated.</p>

  <h2 id='ch28' class='c010'>XXVIII<br /> <br />CIRCUIT TOUR WITH MY DAUGHTER, 1890</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>I had been appointed by Presbytery to organize
in Chieng Rāi the church which was not found
ready for organization on my previous visit. I
had planned for a tour longer than usual, to include
the eastern provinces as far as Nān, as well as the
northern ones, and expected to take with me native
assistants only. But upon the arrival of our reinforcement,
I was no less surprised than delighted to
find that my daughter desired to accompany me; and
so it was arranged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Starting on February 5th, we spent the first Sunday
in Lakawn. Here we met another surprise. Mr.
Taylor had spent his first year in that annoying
work for the new missionary, the building of a house.
He was anxious to get out among the people, but
feared he was not sufficiently versed in the language
to make profitable a tour alone. He and Mrs. Taylor
would join us if they could get elephants—a matter
which was easily arranged. Mr. Taylor proved to be
an efficient helper. My daughter had a delightful companion,
and it was a great pleasure to initiate the new
missionaries into the evangelistic work which Dr. and
Mrs. Taylor since then have carried on so successfully
for twenty years. It is still their delight—may they
live to carry it on for many years to come!</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the chief diversions of the trip thenceforward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>was afforded by the pranks of an uncommonly mischievous
baby-elephant which accompanied its mother.
On one occasion a footman coming towards us stepped
out of the trail and stood beside a large tree to let
us pass. The mischievous creature saw his opportunity,
and before the man knew what was up, he
found himself fast pinioned between the elephant’s
head and the tree trunk. The frightened man extricated
himself with loud outcry, while the beholders
were convulsed with laughter. Our own men were constantly
the victims of his pranks; so that, one day, I
told them that there would be no trouble if they
would only leave the creature alone—adding, by way
of clinching my advice, “You see, he never troubles
me.” Just then, to the great delight of all, he made
straight for me, and if there had been a tree behind
me I should have been in the same unpleasant position
in which the footman found himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Taylor’s account of the earlier portion of the trip
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>“We left Lakawn on the 12th of February with Dr. McGilvary
and his daughter, and in four days reached Mûang
Prê. Our tents were pitched by the road just outside the city
gate. The advent of four foreigners, two of whom were
women, created quite a stir; and we were all kept abundantly
busy in visiting and being visited. Mrs. Taylor and Miss
McGilvary were the first white ladies to visit the place;
and of course, much to their own discomfort, were the centre
of attraction....</p>

<p class='c027'>“The people of Prê seemed very ready to listen to the
Gospel; so plenty of auditors were found everywhere. On
Sabbath, the 16th, the first convert in Prê was baptized.
He is a blind man, Noi Wong by name, who came to
Lakawn to have Dr. Peoples operate on his eyes; but as
nothing could be done for him, he returned home carrying in
his heart some of the teachings there received, and in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>hand a manuscript copy of a small catechism I was able to
spare him. From his answers before the session, it was evident
that he had used his brother’s eyes well in having it
read to him.</p>

<p class='c027'>“On Wednesday we started on for Nān, and arrived there
the following Tuesday. We received a very cordial welcome
from the officials of that city, who sent a man to put in order
a rest-house for us, and another to conduct our elephants to
a place for food and water. Next day, after the court closed,
some of the officials came to visit us. After wading through
the crowds on the first and second verandas, and finally
planting himself cross-legged in the middle of the thronged
reception-room, their Chief said they thought we would be
lonesome; so they had come to visit us. No idea could have
been more comical to us; but he was seriously in earnest,
and explained that he had never known the people to visit
with other foreigners who had come to their city. They
would not, however, listen well when the subject of religion
was broached, and with one or two exceptions would not attend
any of our services.”</p>

<p class='c025'>The morning after our arrival in Nān, my
daughter met in the market-place a daughter of the
Prince, and, before she was aware, found herself
escorted into the palace. Her newly recovered language
stood her in good stead, and she had a pleasant
talk with the Prince and his daughters and wives.
Next day he sent word that he would be pleased to give
our party an audience. He was of venerable age, and
second only to our Chiengmai Prince in his influence
at the court of Bangkok. He expressed his pleasure at
our visit to his country. He was too old to embrace
a new religion. We might teach his children and
grandchildren. What they would do he did not
know.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Nān the Taylors left us, returning to their station,
while we journeyed on. Our next stage was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Chieng Kawng, one hundred and fifty miles to the
northwest. We usually stopped for the night at large
villages, or sometimes in small towns. But once we
spent two days in the forest, where bears, tigers, and
wild elephants abound. The first evening we just
missed the sight of three tigers. Our men had gone on
ahead to select a camping-place for the night, and saw
a mother with two cubs crossing the road. Next
morning one of my elephants, that had been hobbled
and turned loose, was not on hand. It was nothing
unusual for one of them to be a little belated, so we
loaded up the others and prepared for starting. But
when an hour had passed, and then two hours, and the
elephant still did not come, we unloaded them and
waited a long weary day and an anxious night. Early
next morning, however, the driver appeared. That
was a relief, but still there was no elephant. He had
followed her trail over the mountain ridge, down
gorges, and across knolls, till, tired and hungry, he
had retraced his steps. Night overtook him, and,
crouched under a tree, he had caught snatches of sleep
while keeping watch for tigers. For two nights and a
day he had not tasted food. With an elephant’s instinct,
the beast was making her way towards her old
range in Chieng Rāi, many days distant. It was a
relief to know that she had not joined a large wild
herd, in which case her capture would be practically
impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>We could not remain indefinitely in the forest. So
giving the driver food, a gun, and two carriers for
company, with instructions not to return till the elephant
was found, we moved on five or six miles to the
next village, Bān Kêm. This was the noon of Wednesday.
Our detention seemed providential. We found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>the place fever-stricken. Our medicines at once made
us friends. Our tent was crowded with visitors, so
that I had little time to think of the lost elephant. The
people seemed hungry for the Gospel. Three substantial
men in the village, on the night before we left,
professed a sincere and cordial acceptance of Jesus as
their Saviour.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Saturday, shortly after midday, there was a
shout, “Here comes Lung Noi with the elephant!”
I was both glad and sorry to hear it. Had I been alone,
I should have remained longer. But we had lost so
much time, that every one was eager to depart. I
promised if possible to come again, but the time never
came.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chieng Kawng was our next point, a place I had
visited with Dr. Vrooman seventeen years before. The
young lad who then was so much interested in my repeating
rifle was now governor, and came running out,
bareheaded and barefooted, to welcome us. In the interval
I had met him from time to time in Chiengmai,
and he always begged that I would make him another
visit. I had been better than my word—I had come
at last, and brought my daughter, too. His brother,
the second governor, had seen us in time to don his
audience dress, and he appeared more like a white
man than any one we had seen since the Taylors left
us. He was ready to start on an expedition to Mûang
Sing, five days northward beyond the Mê Kōng. The
Prince of Nān had received permission from the King
of Siam to repeople that old province. Hence this expedition.
The leader had three hundred men, and gave
me a cordial invitation to go as chaplain and physician!
After this, while the work was well under way,
the territory was turned over to France as the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of the long and troubled negotiations over the boundary
between Siam and French Indo-China.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wives of both the governors could scarcely be
content with my daughter’s short stay. They would
surely become Christians, if she would remain one
month to teach them. All I could do was to promise
once more to come again if possible. The promised
visit was made two years later, but then the “Nāi”
was not along.</p>

<p class='c009'>From there the only travelled route to Chieng Sên
was by Chieng Rāi, both hot and circuitous. The alternative
was a blind, untravelled track through the
forest, made over forty years before, when Siam sent
its last unfortunate expedition against Keng Tung.
Here was a tempting chance to test the old proverb,
Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The governor
procured a noted hunter to guide us. Every carrier
and driver and servant in the party carried his bush
knife, and all promised to aid if we only would take
the cooler road. It was, however, literally making in
the forest “a highway for our God,” over which several
missionary tours have since been made. In the denser
parts of the forest, we could force our way only by cutting
away branches and small trees, and at times felling
clumps of bamboo.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had a cool place for rest and worship on Sunday.
Our hunter had not promised to keep the Sabbath,
and we were on his old hunting-grounds, where game
of all kinds abounded. At dawn he was off with his
gun, and we saw no more of him till sunset, when he
appeared smiling, with some choice cuts of beef hanging
from the barrel of his gun. He had found and followed,
all day, a herd of wild cattle—the Kating—and
succeeded in killing one of them near our road, a mile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>or more ahead of our camp. Though killed on Sunday,
we ate it and asked no questions for conscience’
sake. It was surely the most delicious beef we ever
tasted. We should have had a mutiny the next day,
had we proposed to pass on without stopping to save
the meat. And what a huge creature it was. It must
have weighed nearly a ton. Our men extemporized
frames over the fire, and were busy cutting up the meat
and drying it until late at night. Next day each man
went loaded with it to his utmost capacity. What we
could not carry away, the guide stored in the fork of a
tree against his return.</p>

<p class='c009'>The journey through the forest was shorter and far
more comfortable than would have been the regular
route. When next I travelled it, it had become a
public highway. And as long as I continued to
journey that way, it was known as the “Teacher’s
Road.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Chieng Sên was the limit of our trip. Before reaching
it, we began to hear rumours of war—that the city
was blockaded, no one being permitted to enter or
depart. The country population had been called in
to defend the city, etc., etc. We were advised to return,
but kept on. At the gate the guard admitted us
without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The disturbance was the aftermath of the previous
year’s tax-rebellion, which, as we supposed, was completely
ended before we left home. But a portion of
the insurgents had fled to Keng Tung, and, gathering
there a larger force, came south again as far as Mûang
Fāng, where they were either captured or again scattered.
It was the fear that this lawless band, on its
retreat northward, might attack and plunder the city,
that caused the confusion. But the fugitives would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>have been fools to linger about two weeks after their
defeat, when they knew that both the army behind
them and the country in front of them would be on
the alert for their capture. The governor was delighted
to see us, and we were able in some degree
to allay his fears. We were there, too, to speak a
word of comfort to our own flock, who, like the rest,
had been called in to protect the city. The panic
gradually subsided, and the people returned to their
homes. Owing in part to the unsettled condition of
the country, we did not remain long in Chieng Sên; but
long enough to visit in their homes every Christian
family save one, and to have a delightful communion
season with the church on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our special commission on this tour was to organize
a church in Chieng Rāi, where our next Sunday
was spent. Our governor friend was disappointed that
we had not come to take possession of the fine lot on
the bank of the Mê Kok which he had given us. At
his suggestion a house on it was purchased from his
son at a nominal price, with the promise that we
would urge the mission to occupy it the next year. On
April 13th, the three sections of the church assembled
by invitation at Mê Kawn. The obstacles which prevented
the organization before were now removed.
Fifty-one communicants and thirty-two non-communing
members were enrolled, two ruling elders were
elected and ordained, and the new church started with
fair prospects.</p>

<p class='c009'>We reached home on April 29th, after an absence
of eighty-one days. We found all well, and the work
prospering along all the lines. It was none too soon,
however. We were just in time to escape the rise of
the streams. At our last encampment on the Mê
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Kūang we had a great storm of wind and rain, with
trees and branches falling about us. The trip was a
long one for my daughter; but her presence greatly enhanced
the importance of the tour. On my subsequent
tours through that region the first question always
was, “Did you bring the Nāi?” and the second, “Why
not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>On our return we were surprised to find Dr. McKean
in a new and comfortable teak house, toward
the erection of which neither axe nor saw nor plane
had been used when we left. The saw-mill could deliver
at once whatever was needed. But <i>my</i> house had
been seven years in building!</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time nearly all the Lāo cities of Siam had
been visited by missionaries. In two of them—Chiengmai
and Lakawn—we had established permanent stations.
For the third station, Chieng Rāi seemed to
present the strongest claim. Politically it was not so
important as Nān. But Nān, while very cordial to
foreigners personally, was very jealous about admitting
foreign influence of any kind. And the absolute control
of the people by the princes of Nān would be an
obstacle in the way of the acceptance of Christianity
there until the princes themselves embraced it. In
Chieng Rāi province the governor was known to be
favourable to the Jesus-religion. Its broad plains and
fertile soil were sure to attract a large immigration
from the south, where population is dense and land
very dear. The city is about equidistant from the five
cities of Wieng Pā Pāo on the south, Mûang Fāng on
the west, Chieng Sên on the north, Chieng Kawng on
the northeast, and Chieng Kam on the east. In our
reports to the mission and to the Board, these facts
were urged as arguments for the establishment of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>station there. The mission gave its cordial sanction
to a temporary occupancy. A longer tour was authorized
for the next season; but the heavy debt of the
Board forbade the expenditure of more than two hundred
and fifty rupees for a temporary house in order
to secure the land which had been given us. Our long
delay sorely shook the good governor’s faith that we
would ever come.</p>

<p class='c009'>The arrival of young missionaries on the field rendered
some kind of physical and social recreation necessary.
Croquet had formerly been tried, but it gave
very little exercise, and had been supplanted by the
better game of lawn tennis. In the fall of 1890, Mrs.
McGilvary prepared a court in our front lot, and invited
the missionaries and the small European community
to an “At Home” on Tuesdays at 4:30 P.M.
The game furnished the very exercise needed after a
day’s confinement in school or study. It proved so
beneficial to health and to efficiency in work, that the
“At Home” was continued, with occasional interruptions
from weather or other causes, for thirteen or
fourteen years. This was Mrs. McGilvary’s little contribution
to the health and the social recreation of the
community in which we lived; and it was highly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c009'>In August I had occasion to visit Wieng Pā Pāo.
Before I was out of the Chiengmai plain I had an exciting
runaway on my big sadaw elephant. A mother
cow was grazing at some little distance from her calf.
As the elephant approached the calf, the mother became
alarmed for its safety, and rushed frantically
towards it, bellowing to the utmost capacity of her
lungs. This was quite too much for my big timid
beast. He started off at a fearful pace, which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>driver in vain endeavoured to control. Fortunately it
was on an open plain with no woods or trees. The same
elephant on a previous occasion, when Mrs. McGilvary
was riding him, on some slight alarm rushed off into
a thicket of low trees; and once, with me on his back,
went crashing through the standing timber in the
forest. In both cases it was nothing but the strength
of the three-strand rattan girth that saved either howdah
or rider. The elephant’s fastest run is not a
“lope,” but a kind of long swing from side to side.
It is an awful sensation. I never was in an earthquake,
but I imagine the two experiences must be
somewhat similar, with the fear in this case of being
at any instant dashed from your lofty perch to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>The special reason for this trip was the fear of some
collision or trouble between the government and the
Christians with regard to the Sunday question. Besides
keeping their own Sabbath, the Christians were
forbidden to do any manual work on the Buddhist
sacred days as well, making altogether eight days in
each month. Had the rule been the outcome of conscientious
scruples on the part of a religious people at
seeing their sacred day desecrated, we should have respected
their scruples. But the day was a mere holiday,
and, except by a few of the more religious, it was
largely spent in hunting and fishing. I had to remind
the governor of his beautiful inconsistency. He
would not allow the Christians to use an axe or a plow
on sacred days, while the people generally were allowed
to kill animals, thus breaking the most stringent
of Buddha’s laws. He must have felt the force of the
argument, for before the very next sacred day an
order was issued forbidding hunting and fishing on it.</p>

December. Just before it convened, Dr. and Mrs. W.

Dr. and Mrs. Peoples, returning from furlough. For
the present these were stationed at Lakawn. At the
same time Rev. and Mrs. Stanley K. Phraner were
nearing Chiengmai on the Mê Ping fork. But our
song of joy over their arrival was destined soon again
to have a sad refrain. The two young brides had
scarcely reached their husbands’ field of labour—which
they thought was to be theirs also—when they were
both called to a higher sphere.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>While in the United States, Dr. Peoples had
succeeded in procuring a font of Lāo type,
with the necessary equipment for printing.
For twenty-three years we had used only the Siamese
Scriptures and literature. With many present disadvantages,
it had some compensations. Those who
could read Siamese had access to the whole of the
Old and New Testaments. The press was set up in
Chiengmai, and Rev. D. G. Collins was made manager.
The first printing done was Mrs. McGilvary’s
translation of the Gospel of Matthew.</p>

<p class='c009'>My daughter had been sent down to aid the Phraners
on their river trip. Word was sent ahead that Mrs.
Phraner was not well. As they drew nearer, her condition
became so critical that Dr. McKean hastened
with all speed to meet them. When she reached
Chiengmai, her condition, while still critical, was more
hopeful. I was ready to start on my tour as soon as
the party arrived. When I left home, we were still
hopeful that rest, kind nursing, and medical treatment
would set her right again.</p>

<p class='c009'>During my absence this year I was fortunate enough
to receive a regular weekly mail from Chiengmai. A
staff of engineers were surveying a railroad route for
the Siamese government, and had a weekly mail sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>to their stations along the line. They were very kind
to include my letters also, which was particularly fortunate
in that thus I could have news of the invalid
left behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have learned to start on my tours with very flexible
plans, leaving much to the guidance of providential
openings on the way. On this trip, at the village
of Pāng Krai—which, because it was a mile or
two away from the road, I had not visited in seventeen
years—I was delayed three days by a reception so cordial
that I could not pass on. On my previous trip a
man from the village, Noi Tēchō by name, came with
his little girl across to our camp and begged us to
visit it. This I could not then do; but he remained
with us till late at night, and seemed to be a believer.
I now found that in the interval the man had
kept the Sabbath, and had given such other evidence
of his sincerity, that we could not refuse his reception
to the communion and fellowship of the church. On
the last night of our stay we had a baptismal and communion
service that was memorable. The man made a
good confession before many witnesses, and his little
daughter was baptized as a non-communing member.</p>

<p class='c009'>As in many other cases, this family had been
driven by trouble to our religion. Originally he was
the slave of a prince in Lakawn. The accusation of
witchcraft then settled on the family; but before they
were driven off the Prince compelled them to borrow
money in order to redeem themselves from him—to do
which the man had to give two of his children as security.
After a move or two, he was driven by famine
from Lakawn, and came to this village.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning at Wieng Pā Pāo I was summoned
in great haste to attend one of the engineers who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>was thought to have been nearly killed by a fall from
a runaway horse. I found that he had broken a collar-bone,
but was otherwise uninjured. I applied all
of my amateur surgical skill, and set the bone. But
my patient, naturally enough, could not feel quite sure;
and thought it safer to go down to our hospital and get
Dr. McKean’s judgment on the case. He found the
bone set all right.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late one Saturday evening I reached Bān Pā Hōng
in Chieng Rāi province, and stopped with the first
Christian family. Next day I learned that in the next
section of the village there was a Christian girl very
low with consumption. Early on Monday morning I
moved on, but was only in time to see a lovely form
and face apparently in the most natural sleep; but
the living soul had departed. I had baptized her two
years before, when she was fourteen years of age.
She had been sick for seven months, and had spent
most of the time in prayer. It made me inexpressibly
sad when I learned that her strongest desire was to see
her own “Paw Krū” before she departed. On the
previous evening, when she heard that we had reached
the village near by, she said, “And the Paw Krū is at
Noi Lin’s, and I cannot see him!” I preached her
funeral sermon, and saw her decently buried.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The next Sunday morning, while sitting in the Mê
Kawn chapel and preparing for service, I looked up
and saw standing on the ground before the door some
people in a strange costume evidently not Lāo, looking
in as if in doubt whether to enter or not. I immediately
recognized them as belonging to the Mūsô tribe,
quite numerous in the mountains near by. Their ready
acceptance of my invitation to come in showed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>they were waiting to be asked, and feared only lest
they might be intruders. As the Mūsôs will be prominent
in our narrative of this and the two following
years, a word of introduction may be desirable.</p>

<p class='c009'>They are one of a numerous group of hill-tribes which
have gradually followed the mountain ridges down
from the interior of the continent. They live under a
patriarchal government, if it may be rightly called a
government at all; and they enjoy great personal freedom,
though the authority of the clan approaches very
near to absolute despotism. They are worshippers of
spirits, which are held to preside over the universe
and the destinies of men generally; while as a tribe
they are under the guardianship of their own “spirits.”
They have a twelfth—day sabbath or sacred day, not
very definitely marked. They make a great deal of
their “kin waw” or New Year feast, when all communication
with other villages even of their own tribe
is cut off during the five or seven days of their feasting.
The religious head of the village is called Pū Chān,
and the head Pū Chān of a province holds in his hands
the conscience of all his flock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their manner of life is as follows: They select a locality,
the higher up the better, near the source of a
mountain brook. They fell the trees and undergrowth
at the close of the rainy season, let them dry during
the hot season, and just before the next rainy season
set fire to the clearing on a windy day. All that is
readily combustible is consumed, leaving the logs on
the ground. With a small hoe or a narrow spade they
make shallow openings in the earth some ten inches
apart, all over the field, and deposit in each a dozen
rice grains, more or less. The rains do the rest till the
harvest. The second year’s crop is the best, but it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>seldom that they can compete with the scrub-growth
for a third crop. A temporary shack is easily erected,
if possible, contiguous to three clearings. When these
are abandoned, they move on and repeat the operation
elsewhere. By this means all the higher mountains
are being steadily denuded of their forests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being bound by no system of hoary age and venerable
associations, like Buddhism or Brahmanism, most of
the hill-tribes are very receptive of the Gospel. Their
clannishness, however, is such that if they become
Christians at all, they come in a body. But it is
very difficult for individuals or families to break away
from the clan. At the same time their migratory and
unsettled habits are by no means favourable to their
education and civilization. To any other power than
that of the Gospel that would seem to be a hopeless
task.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to return to our visitors at the chapel. There
were seven men and boys in the party. The spokesman,
Cha Pū Kaw, was tall and well proportioned,
with the bearing of one who might be a leader of some
position. He understood Lāo better than most of his
tribe, and through him it was by no means difficult
to draw the others into conversation. They were from
three families that had been driven down nearer the
plain by accusation of witchcraft. They had learned
from our elder that Christians were not afraid of
witchcraft, nor of expulsion from the country. They
had also talked over with him the plan of salvation
for sinful men provided in the Gospel, and had asked
to be informed whenever we should come again. They
readily consented to remain through the morning
service, which was modified to suit the needs of the new
audience. It was the first Christian worship they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>had ever attended, and they were evidently pleased.
The Christians invited them to share their dinner,
and the most of the afternoon was given up to their
instruction. The boys were put to reading the catechism
and learning to sing the Lāo version of “There
is a Happy Land.” They remained with us till there
was only light enough left to enable them to find
their way home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early next morning we crossed the plain to the foot
of the mountain, where we struck the little brook
along which and in which lay our pathway. The climb
was a stiff one, but with noble outlooks over the plain
below. In their little hamlet there were three families,
or, rather, three divisions of one family, numbering
twenty-six souls. By their intercourse with
the Christians at the chapel the soil had been prepared
for the seed. So from nine o’clock till noon we
addressed ourselves to teaching the elders, while the
children were becoming more and more interested in
the catechism, and especially in the “Happy Land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While the men and boys were thus engaged, the
grandmother and her daughters were busy preparing
dinner. When all was ready, the steaming white
rice was emptied on a board like that on which our
housewives knead their bread. With it was a vegetable
curry, sweet potatoes steamed over the rice, bananas,
and other fruits, with native sugar in cakes for dessert.
The board piled with food was set before me, and I was
invited to partake. They were delighted that I could
eat and enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all had finished their meal, the exercises of
the morning were resumed, with the women now disengaged
and free to listen. Long before night Cha Pū
Kaw and his brother-in-law, Cha Waw, of about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>same age, expressed their firm belief in the truth of
our religion, and their acceptance of the Gospel offer
as far as they understood it. The women said they
would follow their husbands. The sun was already
getting low when we had worship together before leaving.
When we came to bid our hosts good-bye, we
found that we were to be escorted down by the two
elder men and the boys, lest a tiger might meet us on
the way. It was almost dark when we reached the
chapel.—A day never to be forgotten!</p>

<p class='c009'>At the chapel I found letters from Chiengmai bringing
the news that Mrs. Phraner’s long and painful sufferings
were ended. She died on February 13th. All
that three able physicians could do was done; but in
vain. Her mother and her family were never willing
that she should become a missionary, being sure that
she could not endure the strain of a missionary’s life.
That fact filled the husband’s cup of sorrow to overflowing.
My letter stated that he was beside himself
with grief; that the physicians, and, in fact, the whole
mission, strongly advised him to join me on my tour;
and that he would reach me not long after the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the following Friday, while getting the new
chapel ready, I heard the shout, “There comes the new
teacher!” He was worn and haggard, and visibly
older than when I left him; but making a brave effort
to be cheerful. He said very little of his great loss.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>On Sunday the whole Mūsô village was on hand long
before the hour for worship. The women came with
their babes tied with a scarf to the mother’s back, according
to their custom. The news that they were
become Christians had spread, and drew a larger number
than usual of our non-Christian neighbours to the
services. The Christians, too, were greatly encouraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>thereby. In the afternoon a few of the tribe
from another village were present, and listened with
surprise to Cha Pū Kaw’s first sermon. He had evidently
entered upon his new faith in earnest, and was
not ashamed to bear his testimony.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday we moved on to Chieng Rāi, where I was
to direct the removal of a house to the lot which the
Governor had offered us. But Mr. Phraner’s condition
demanded movement and change of scene. Arrangements
were, therefore, made to have the house moved
by others, while we went on at once to Chieng Sên.
There we found the Chao Uparāt just returned from a
trip via Mûang Len to Mûang Sing, some hundred
miles or so to the northeast on the other side of the
Mê Kōng River. He was profuse in his praise both
of Mûang Sing and of the journey thither; and suggested
that it would be a fine opening for a mission,
and a most interesting tour. The suggestion seemed
attractive to us both. So, after a week of work in the
church and in the city of Chieng Sên, we started for
Mûang Len and Mûang Sing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Len is the common market centre of a large
number of hill-tribes that inhabit the mountain ridges
in all directions round about. All the cities and towns
north of Chieng Sên hold a fifth-day fair or market.
We were fortunate in striking market-day on the Saturday
of our arrival. Early in the morning people began
to pour into the place from all directions. The
mountain tribes came out, their beaux and belles all
in gala dress, some to buy and sell, and others because
it was their weekly holiday.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Chieng Sên I had brought along Nān Suwan,
the Lû elder, who had come into closer contact with
these mountain tribes than had our elders from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>south. He could make the men, and especially the head
men, understand fairly well. To all who understood
the Lāo I could, of course, speak directly. We took
our stand at the end of the market, and the crowd
gathered about us. None of them had ever seen a
missionary. None, save some few of the Lāo men, had
ever read a book, or knew even a letter of any written
language. They were children of nature, artless
and unsophisticated. We pressed home the thought,
new to them, that there must be a maker of the world
and of all creatures in it. We told them the old, old
story of the infinite love of God, our Father, and of
Christ, His Son, who suffered and died to save us, and
of pardon freely promised to all who believe in Him.
This is the final argument that wins these people.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the merely curious among the crowd had withdrawn,
this doctrine of salvation from sin held the
more thoughtful, and brought them to our tent in the
afternoon, and even far on into the night. The head
men especially, who were more free to come to me,
expressed a deep personal interest in the new doctrine.
The most interested and interesting man was Sên Ratana,
the governor of the Kôn quarter of the city. We
met him on Sunday. On Monday we called on him and
spent most of the morning at his house, explaining to
him the plan of salvation and dictating to him portions
of Scripture for him to copy; for by this time
the Lāo manuscript copies which we brought with us
were exhausted. He copied, also, the first few questions
and answers of the Shorter Catechism, hoping
that with these as a key, he could learn to read the
Siamese Gospel and catechism which I gave him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On our return to our tent on Monday evening we
found almost a panic among our people. Some lawless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>men had lounged about the tent most of the day,
asking suspicious questions about how much money
we carried, and how many guns, and whither we were
going from there, etc., etc. The result was that those
who had been most eager for the trip beyond the Mê
Kōng to Mûang Sing, began now to beg us to return.
Mr. Phraner, moreover, became uneasy about his borrowed
elephant, which would be a great prize for robbers.
So, after consultation, it was decided to retrace
our steps. However disappointing this might be
to me, I had at least learned the road to Mûang Sing
and Mûang Yawng. The tour to both those places, and
to many others, was only deferred to the following
year, when we might hope to have at least one printed
Gospel in the Lāo language, and a tract or two to distribute.
The news of Cha Pū Kaw’s conversion spread
far and wide, and was preparing the way for further
work among his tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Mûang Len on Wednesday, we breathed more
freely after we had crossed the border into Siam. On
reaching Chieng Sên, Mr. Phraner decided to return
to Chiengmai. He had reaped all the benefit possible
from change of scene. He felt that he ought now to be
in his future home, settling down to a systematic study
of the language. But I greatly missed his pleasant
company.</p>

<p class='c009'>The object of the missionary’s visit to an outlying
church like that of Chieng Sên, is to “lengthen the
cords and strengthen the stakes”—to awaken the
careless, to attract the indifferent, and to deepen impressions
already made. Within the range of influence
of such a church there are always those who, though
taught, indeed, by its native officers, still need further
instruction by the missionary—who have objections to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>be met and doubts to be resolved beyond the power of
these officers to cope with. Not infrequently some one
who is already a believer has a wife, a husband, or children
on whom his own final decision depends. These
must be visited in their homes. Their confidence must
be won and their friendship gained as a preliminary to
awakening their interest in our religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the sake of the Christians personally, as well
as for the work in general, it is important to cultivate
the friendship of the local rulers. It is to them that
the Christians are responsible. And then the Christian
families must be visited, their children instructed,
their difficulties settled, their sick be treated, and instructed
how to treat themselves in our absence; and
as much Scriptural teaching is to be given as our time
by night and by day will permit. But our most important
duty is to instruct the elders themselves, and
give them an uplift.</p>

<p class='c009'>When my work in Chieng Sên was done, I started
for Chieng Kawng, taking Nān Suwan along, for he
was well known there and in most of the region to be
visited as far as Chieng Rāi. The Mê Tam, already
referred to as the stream which rises from under the
mountain west of the plain, becomes quite a river as
it enters the Mê Kōng near Chieng Sên. The bottom
land is covered with reedy grass so tall that a large
elephant carrying a high howdah can be seen only a
short distance away. Here we lost our way completely,
and wandered about bewildered for a long
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>When finally we reached the stream, its trough was
so deep that we failed in a number of attempts to get
down to the water. At last we dug down as best we
could the edge of the high sandy bank, and, after much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>urging, and some protest on his part, my sadaw tremblingly
reached forth his front feet, lay down, and
slid like an alligator, dragging his hind legs after him,
till, with a mighty plunge, we landed in deep water.
It was an awful sensation for the rider. The place
was in a bayou with “back water” so deep as to be
quite over one’s head; and, unlike the natives, the rider
could not swim! The landing on the further shore was
little better. There the elephant struggled up the
bank until he got his forefeet on the edge above. Then,
with a gigantic effort, he drew himself up so suddenly
that the rider had to hold on for dear life to avoid
being thrown over his head. It was a feat that only
an elephant could perform, and one would much prefer
witnessing it from a distance to being on his back during
the operation.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Chieng Kawng I was sorry to find the governor
sadly crippled. In descending a flight of steps he had
slipped to the ground, dislocating his ankle and bruising
the bone. The joint had been barbarously treated,
was fearfully swollen, and caries of the bone had evidently
set in. I urged him to take an elephant and
go to our hospital, as the only possible chance of cure.
He was favourably inclined to the idea, and promised
to do so after trying somewhat longer the incantations
of a noted sorceress, who was believed to have great
power over wounds. It almost passes belief that such
an intelligent man could have any faith in it. Yet reason
and ridicule alike failed to dispel the hope that
she might succeed. The result might have been predicted.
After giving him great suffering, the treatment
cost him his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>While I was in Chieng Kawng, a Nān prince returning
from Mûang Sing brought the news that negotiations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>then on foot between France and Siam would
put a stop to all further settlement of that district;
would, in fact, transfer the whole region east of the
Mê Kōng to France. The Prince of Nān was greatly
disappointed; but little did we think that the transfer
would ultimately prove an effectual barrier to our work
also. It is surely one of the anomalies and anachronisms
of the twentieth century that a Christian nation
of Europe should oppose the introduction of Christianity
into a region over which it has absolute control!</p>

<p class='c009'>On the last night before we left, all the princes and
officers came to see us, and remained till midnight.
They were as loath to have us leave them as we were
to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>The journey from Chieng Kawng was intensely hot;
the thermometer standing at 103° in my howdah by
day, and on one night in my tent at 96°. On the banks
of the Mê Ing I found native white roses in bloom
in abundance, and brought home with me a plant
which Mrs. McGilvary greatly prized, for this was the
only native rose I had found in the Lāo territory.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the way to Mûang Tông I passed the camp of
Chao Wieng Sā, a Nān prince whom I had met in
his home on two former visits. He was overseeing the
felling and running of teak timber down the Mê Ing
and the Mê Kōng to Lūang Prabāng. He had received
and read a Siamese New Testament, was quite familiar
with the life and teachings of Jesus, and admired His
character. A lawsuit afterwards brought him to
Chiengmai, where I saw a great deal of him. He was
surely a believer at heart. To me he was willing to
confess that his only hope was in Jesus Christ, but was
not ready to make a public profession of his faith. I
love to think of many such whom I have met as like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Gamaliels, the Nicodemuses, and the Josephs of Christ’s
day.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>At Mûang Tông, as soon as I dismounted from my
elephant an officer met me to enquire who I was, and
to escort me to the public sālā. I soon learned that he
was the brother of another officer whom I had found
on the road to Chieng Rāi the year before, unable to
travel and, apparently, sick unto death with fever. His
company could not linger indefinitely in the forest,
and so had left him there with two men to watch him,
and probably to see him die. A dose of calomel, and
the quinine which I left with instructions as to its
use, seem to have cured his fever and enabled him to
reach his home in safety. He was himself now absent,
but his brother’s heart had been opened to friendship,
and he did all that he could for my comfort. At
night he invited his friends to the sālā to meet me,
and we had an interesting evening. In all these places
Nān Suwan and Noi Siri would often be heard talking
to the audience after I had retired, and until sleep
closed my eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>During our absence from Chieng Rāi a case of oppression,
or, at least, of evident injustice, on the part
of the Court, had led our friend the governor to take all
Christians under his personal protection as his own
dependents. The kindness was well meant, and we
thanked him for it. But I doubted its wisdom. The
only scheme under which Christianity can really establish
itself in all lands, is to have Christians stand on
precisely the same level before the law as Buddhists
or Brahmans or the followers of any other religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Chieng Rāi the elders were sent on to Cha Pū
Kaw’s village to see how the Mūsôs were getting on. I
followed them in a day or two. When I reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>chapel at Mê Kawn, the elders had returned from the
Mūsô village with a glowing account of their constancy.
This the testimony of Noi Tāliya and of all
the Lāo Christians confirmed. They had not missed a
single Sunday service; old and young alike came, and
mothers, as before, bringing their children tied on their
backs. They had shamed the Lāo Christians by their
earnestness, getting to the chapel first, studying hard,
and returning home late.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Saturday morning the whole village came down,
and we spent the day together. They remained that
night as the guests of the Lāo. The next day, Sunday,
was largely given up to their instruction. They
all had renounced the worship of spirits; they all accepted
Jesus as their Saviour; they were all diligently
learning to read and to sing. Their conduct was most
consistent; they had a good reflex influence upon the
church; and their conversion was an astonishment to
the non-Christian community.</p>

<p class='c009'>These Mūsôs had all come, expecting to join the
church. They had been taught that public baptism—confessing
Christ before men—was the consummating
act, the external seal of their initiation into the privileges
of the church. Although we impressed upon
them that they were not saved by the mere ceremony
of baptism, yet somehow they felt that without it they
were not quite in the church, and hence probably not
quite safe from the spirits. Since it would be nearly
a year before they would have another opportunity, it
seemed unwise not to receive some of them at this
time. The greatest doubt was about Cha Waw. Yet
he felt that more than any other he needed whatever
protection and assistance the church could afford him.
He had begun with his whole strength to break the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>chains of his opium habit, to seek pardon and be saved.
He felt confident that with God’s help he would succeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The final decision was that, in order to bind them
to the service of Christ, they were all to appear before
the session and make their profession; but that only
the two old men should be received into full communion,
and that one grandson from each family be
baptized as non-communing members. It was thought
best to let the others wait till our next visit; though I
have never been satisfied that they should not all have
been admitted that day. Three of these Mūsô boys
accompanied me to Chiengmai on my return, and entered
the Boys’ School. It is not at all surprising that,
in surroundings so different from those of their mountain
homes, they presently grew lonesome and homesick.
But they were satisfactory pupils, and remained
in school long enough to get a good start in
reading and singing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cha Waw, after a manful struggle, finally succeeded
in breaking away entirely from his opium—by the help
of prayer and of quinine, as he always believed and
affirmed. When the non-Christian tribesmen with
their opium pipes visited his village, he was accustomed
to go down to the elders at Mê Kawn, to be away
from temptation, and under Christian influence. He
lived a number of years after this to attest the reality
of his victory—the only case I have ever known where
the victory was surely won.</p>

<p class='c009'>That year there was a famine among all the hill
tribes. The upland rice was almost entirely cut off
by a plague of rats. I do not believe in “rice Christians”;
but when people are famishing with hunger,
I believe in feeding them, whether they are Christians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>or not. These did not ask either for money or for any
other aid. But when I left them, I made arrangement
with the Lāo elders to furnish them with sixty buckets
of rice, for which I paid ten rupees in advance. They
were very grateful for the aid.</p>

<p class='c009'>The days spent among the Mūsôs that week were inspiring.
Glowing visions arose before us of a new
tribe brought into the Christian church, of which these
were the first-fruits. On this whole tour, indeed, only
nine adults and seventeen children were baptized. But
in addition to the opening of work among the Mūsôs,
we had for the first time preached the Gospel beyond
the borders of the kingdom of Siam; and our longing
eyes were turned toward the Sipsawng Pannā, and
beyond the great river. By this time the rains had
already begun to fall. A new season was needed to
fulfil our desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>Much as I always enjoy my long tours, when my
work is done and my face at last is turned homewards,
the gait of my sadaw seems distressingly slow. On
reaching Chiengmai I found all in fair health, and
all departments of work in full operation. But while
I was still on my way, word reached me of the death
of Mrs. Briggs in Lakawn, only a month and nine days
after that of Mrs. Phraner. So unexpected was it
that I was not even aware that she had been ill. In
answer to my request for a few particulars from Dr.
Briggs, I have received the following, which I know he
will excuse me for transferring to these pages:</p>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Mrs. Alice Hamilton Briggs</span> was from Truro, Nova
Scotia. Although within a year of graduation, she gave up
her medical course and accompanied her husband to the
Lāo mission in answer to the call of the Board. When she
bade good-bye to the Secretaries of the Board, Dr. Gillespie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>said to her, ‘It is a pleasure to see you so robust and strong.
In this respect you are better off than your husband. There
have been so many missionary women who have broken
down on the field, that we are glad to see that you have a
reserve of health.’</p>

<p class='c027'>“Before leaving American shores, however, Mrs. Briggs
contracted a slight cough which developed in severity during
the voyage. On her arrival in Siam it became apparent
that the case was one of pulmonary tuberculosis. The disease
seemed to respond to treatment, and for months improvement
was marked. Up to within twenty-four hours of death Mrs.
Briggs was so hopeful of a return to health that she refused
to allow her family at home to know of her condition. On
Saturday she was cutting out a new dress for herself. On
Sunday night she passed away. Dr. Briggs was spending
the evening with her, when a call came to attend a child
said to be dying just across the road. The doctor said he
would be back soon. A few minutes later he was called
back too late even to hear a last word of farewell.”</p>

<p class='c025'>The event most interesting to us as a family during
the fall of this year, 1891, was the arrival of our son
Evander with his young bride, and our daughter Margaret,
to carry on the work begun by their parents.
Our son had made special preparation for translating
the Scriptures into the Lāo language, then the most
pressing need of the mission.</p>

  <h2 id='ch30' class='c010'>XXX<br /> <br />AMONG THE MŪSÔ VILLAGES—FAMINE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>For the tour of 1892 I was to have the company
of Dr. McKean as long as he could be spared
from Chiengmai, which would greatly enhance
the value of the trip. We had also three native
evangelist-assistants, and, last, but not least, we were
well supplied with Scriptures and tracts in the Lāo
dialect. Our start was made on January 5th.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our first two Sundays and the intervening week we
spent in Wieng Pā Pāo, where we established ourselves
in the new chapel which the people themselves had
built since our last tour. We observed the Week of
Prayer with two chapel services daily, and house-to-house
and heart-to-heart work in the intervals. The
church was formally organized with thirty-six adult
members and thirty children, three ruling elders, and
two deacons.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Wieng Pā Pāo we moved on to the village of
Mê Kawn, the centre of our very interesting work of
the previous year among the Mūsô tribe. The Sunday
we spent there was a red-letter day in our missionary
life. Of it Dr. McKean writes: “This has
been a blessed day. All [of the Mūsôs] desire baptism.
Two boys baptized last year were admitted to the
communion. Eleven other adults and seven children
were baptized, making twenty-two Mūsôs now members
of the visible church. One Lāo girl was received on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>confession, and three Lāo children were baptized. Our
Christian Mūsôs were out in full force. A Mūsô officer
and others not Christians attended from another
village. Before this we had visited these people in
their homes. We found that they had built a good
chapel for their worship, a better building than either
of their own houses. They had been very diligent in
observing the Sabbath, in studying the catechism, and
in worship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We could not have been better pleased with our first
success. The exclusion of this little group from the
large villages made it possible and easy for all of them
to become Christians. The whole-hearted zeal with
which they entered the church awakened strong hopes
for the conversion of their race. Cha Pū Kaw’s
knowledge of the Lāo tongue was above the average
even of their head men. It would be a long time before
we could have another such interpreter and assistant.
And he was nearly, or quite, seventy years
old; so that whatever he was to do in teaching his
people must be done soon. It was, therefore, thought
best to make a strong effort through him and his family
during that season.</p>

<p class='c009'>At our next stopping-place, Nāng Lê, we came near
having a serious casualty. Our boys were out on a
deer hunt, and one of them bethought him of a novel
expedient for getting the game. He climbed a tree,
and had the grass fired on the other side of the open
space. The grass was tall and dry, and the wind blew
strong towards him. He became so engrossed in looking
for the deer that he forgot the fire, till it was too
late to flee. He could climb beyond the actual flames;
but meanwhile the whole air had become like the breath
of a furnace. When, at last, the fire had swept past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>him, and he was able to descend, he was a mass of
blisters. The swiftness of the rush of the fire alone
saved his life. Had it been slower, he could not have
escaped suffocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Nāng Lê we visited a very large Mūsô village.
It was a steep foot-climb of four solid hours, and, to
make it longer, our guide missed the way. The first
sign of human life we saw was a Mūsô girl alone watching
a clearing. She fled for dear life, till, recognizing
Cha Pū Kaw’s Mūsô speech, she stopped long enough
to point the way to the village. Her fleet steps outran
ours, and when we reached the village, the people
were already assembling to see the unwonted sight of
the white foreigners. But the community was greatly
disturbed over another matter. One of their leading
officers, it seemed, was accused of being the abode of a
demon that had caused an epidemic of disease. The
authorities were hourly waiting for an order from the
court in Chieng Rāi to expel him and his family by
force from the province. They had heard of Cha Pū
Kaw’s conversion, and were anxious to hear from himself
his reasons therefor—which he gave and enforced
till late in the night. They were expecting, however,
on the morrow a regular conflict which might result
in bloodshed, and they evidently preferred that we
should not be there. The head Pū Chān was several
days’ journey distant. They would confer together
among themselves and with him, would let us know
the result, and would invite us up again before we
left their neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>About midnight a fierce storm of wind and rain
broke upon us to our great discomfort. Our thin tent
afforded but poor protection. We doubled up our bedding
over our clothes, and sat upon the pile under our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>umbrellas, and laughed at the novelty of our situation
and the poor prospect of a night’s sleep. But later
the storm passed off, and we did get a little sleep.
Our visit to that group of Mūsô villages was evidently
not well timed. We took the advice of their officers,
and returned to Nāng Lê.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days later we reached Chieng Sên. Here we received
a mail from home, with news that Mrs. McKean
was not well, and other members of the station needed
the doctor’s presence. It was expressed as “the unanimous
judgment of the station that he should return
immediately.” We had planned a regular campaign in
the Mūsô districts on both sides of the Mê Kōng—the
sort of trip in which the medical missionary finds his
best opportunity. But the recall was so imperative
that it could not be ignored. So I was left to continue
the work alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mūsô tribe was about equally numerous in the
mountain ranges on both sides of the big river. On
the east side there were eleven villages. It seemed advisable
to take that section first, because they were under
Chieng Sên rulers, of whose cordial and sincere interest
in our work we were sure. Sên Chai, the head
man of the large village nearest to the city, was a
friend of Nān Suwan, and was strongly inclined to
embrace our religion; but felt the difficulty of breaking
the tribal bond. Before this I had made him a
visit of two or three days, and saw clearly that our
only chance of accomplishing anything was to gain all
the head men of the eleven villages. It was actually
easier to win over the whole as a unit than to win it
piecemeal. This was a formidable task to undertake,
but with God’s blessing on the labours of Cha Pū
Kaw and Nān Suwan, it seemed not impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>We set out for the first village one morning shortly
after ten o’clock. It was four o’clock when we stopped
for rest at the first cluster of houses on the outskirts
of the settlement. The news of our arrival soon
reached the main village. When we started again we
met Sên Chai with a regular serenade-party of men
and boys with native reed instruments, blowing their
plaintive dirge-like music, to welcome us and escort
us in. Soon the population was all assembled—the
maidens in their best sarongs, the mothers and grandmothers
each with an urchin strapped to her back by
her scarf, the men coming in from their work, and the
inevitable crowd of children. Cha Pū Kaw was already
answering their questions, with Nān Suwan’s
sympathetic aid. They were respectfully shy, but there
was no cringing. Sên Chai invited the local Pū Chān
and all the villagers to assemble after their evening
meal to hear the new doctrines. We first had worship
with singing, and prayer by Cha Pū Kaw. It was the
first time they had heard the Great Spirit addressed
in their own Mūsô tongue. There were frequent exclamations
of delight that they were able to understand
every word.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, before that motley crowd, drinking with
them their native tea from an earthen teapot, the men
seated close around, or reclining as they smoke their
pipes, the women and children walking about or sitting
on the ground—we tell of God the great Spirit, the
Creator, and Father of all—the Bible, His message to
men—the incarnation, life, and death of Christ, and
redemption through His blood. Before we get through
you will hear man after man say, “I believe that. It
is true.” One man takes up the story from Cha Pū
Kaw’s mouth and repeats it to another—a story that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>till now he himself had never heard. Another says,
“Nān Suwan has told us this before, but now we hear
it from the father-teacher.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before we retired that night Sên Chai said to us,
with the approval of most of his village, “Go on to
Sên Bun Yūang and the head men of the other villages.
If they agree, we will all accept Christianity. One village
cannot accept it alone. If we do not ‘kin waw’
with them—join in their New Year’s feast—we shall
be treated as enemies by the whole tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So, next morning, we set out to find the great Pū
Chān—the religious head of the province. On our
way to his village we fell in with a man to whom Cha
Pū Kaw was speaking with great earnestness. I found
on approaching him that he was not a Mūsô, but a Kūi—of
a tribe which we had planned to visit later. He
was the Pū Chān of his village. He had already invited
us through Cha Pū Kaw to change our plan,
and visit his village first. It was nearer than the village
we were intending to visit, and we were already
tired enough with our climb to be willing to stop at
the nearest place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The village was a large one, as mountain villages go—of
twenty-five or thirty houses, and from two hundred
and fifty to three hundred souls—in general not unlike
the Mūsô villages we had seen. The Kūi language
also, while different from the Mūsô, is cognate with it,
so that Cha Pū Kaw could still act fairly well as our
interpreter. His talk with the Pū Chān on the way
had already laid a good foundation for our work in the
evening, when curiosity and interest in our errand
brought the whole village together to hear Cha Pū
Kaw’s new doctrine from his own lips. The news of
his conversion had already reached them, and he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>made a good impression on the religious head of the village.—And,
then, it was something new to see the Mūsô
boys able to read and to sing. Nān Suwan and Cha
Pū Kaw led in prayer, the one in Lāo and the other in
Mūsô. Then our religion was explained in its two
leading ideas—rejection of the spirit-cult, and acceptance
of Jesus for the pardon of sin and the life eternal.
Questions were asked and answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the Pū Chān suggested that, while we continued
our reading and singing with the women and
children, he and the men, with Cha Pū Kaw, withdraw
to a neighbouring house and talk the matter over. It
was evident that they would be more at their ease by
themselves, unawed by the presence of the foreign
teacher. For some two hours the debate continued.
I could hear their earnest voices from the neighbouring
house, with only now and then a Lāo word that I
could understand. Then they returned to make their
report. With oriental politeness, they expressed their
gratitude to the “great teacher” who had come so far
and at such expense, and had brought with him a fellow-mountaineer
of theirs, to teach them, creatures of
the jungle, the way to happiness. They had talked
these matters over, and understood them somewhat, but
not fully. Some were greatly pleased with the teachings,
and believed them true. But they could not yet
come as an entire village, and they dared not separate.
Next morning we parted as friends. They were glad
that we had found the way to their village. “Be sure
to come again!” That I thought surely I should do;
but this proved to be my only visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Sên Lūang’s village, where the great Pū Chān
lived, we had the same experience—a good reception,
many apparently interested and anxious to escape their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>own spirit-worship. A number of the head men said,
“If such and such a village accepts the Jesus-religion,
we will.” But no one could be found to face the clan
and make a start.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thinking that our native evangelists might get at
the heart of the people all the better if left to do it
alone, and being anxious to get my mail from home, I
went down on Saturday to Nān Suwan’s to spend the
Sunday there with the Christians. On Tuesday, to my
disappointment, the evangelists returned to me discouraged.
They were convinced that in the district
east of the Mê Kōng River, no break in the
solidarity of the clan could be accomplished that
season.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was important not to leave these people with
the impression that we had abandoned them. I had
left Sên Chai’s village with the promise to return. So
I went up with the Mūsô Christian boys, and spent a
last night with them. The village again assembled,
and we had an interesting evening. The Sên was
greatly disappointed that none of the other villages
would join him. But the New Year was at hand, when
the clan must be unbroken. They would wait another
year, and try to get the other villages to join them. On
the whole, I was encouraged. When we left them we
were escorted out of the village to the music of their
plaintive flutes, more like a victorious than a vanquished
army.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a day or two with the Chieng Sên church, we
visited the ridge to the southeast of that city, between
it and Chieng Kawng. Our experience there was but
a repetition of that from which we were just come—cordial
receptions, night audiences, manifest interest,
individual believers, anxious consultations, promises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>for the next year; but the tribal bond was too strong
to be broken.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Cha Pū Kaw was anxious that we should not
pass by his own mountain villages on the Mê Kok. So
we turned southward again toward Chieng Rāi. This,
moreover, was one of those famine years, such as we
have already encountered in our story, and shall encounter
yet again; many people were on the verge of
starvation. In places we could not get food for our own
men. And famine was beginning to be followed by
disease and death. This was a serious obstacle to
our work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another serious obstacle was the use of opium, which
became more prevalent the further west we went along
the Mê Kok range towards Mûang Fāng. We presently
reached villages where the poppy was cultivated,
until, in the last village, men, women, and boys, and
sometimes even girls, were its slaves. Fevers and dysentery
prevail during the rainy season. These people
have a very scanty pharmacopœia, and no antidotes
whatever for these diseases. Opium in some form is
probably their surest remedy. Many persons told me
that they began by using it in sickness. As sickness recurred
the habit grew, until they were fast bound in
its chains. These facts largely determined the character
of the instruction we gave, and made our tour
a kind of anti-opium crusade. Encouraged and disappointed
at every village, I was still tempted on by
visions of capturing some large village that would
prove a more effective entering wedge for the tribe than
Cha Pū Kaw’s poor little hamlet. The six weeks so
spent were at the time the most novel and exciting, as
well as most arduous, of all my missionary experiences
so far.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>We took both the old Mūsô men as assistants, and
the younger ones as carriers for our equipment. Our
first day’s journey was a fair sample of what we had
to do continually. In many places it would be a misnomer
to speak of the track we travelled as a path.
We left the plain in the morning, and it was half-past
two in the afternoon when we reached the first summit.
It was five o’clock when, desperate with thirst, we came
upon a flowing brook. There was, then, still another
hard climb before we saw our long looked-for first village
ahead. And, in general, because of the habit these
people have of planting their villages upon the very
highest points where they can get water, the journey
from one of these villages to another in plain sight,
and, apparently, but a short distance away, would take
hours of the hardest travel. Sometimes we would walk
weary hours through rain, or through bushes as wet as
rain, to visit a village; only to walk back again after
sitting three hours in wet clothes trying in vain to
awaken some interest in old or young.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most interesting, and, at the same time,
one of the saddest, cases we met was that of Mûn
Kamprai, the head man of a village which clearly bore
the impress of his character in the intelligence and industry
of its inhabitants. From opium he had kept
entirely aloof until, only a few years before this time,
under the stress of a severe illness, he began to take it.
The poor man now realized that he was becoming a
wreck, but seemed to have no will-power left to make
the effort to break away from the habit. He was much
interested, however, in his two fellow-tribesmen whom
I had brought as my assistants; and Cha Waw’s example
seemed to afford him a faint gleam of hope. If
we would stop a week and teach his people, and would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>stand by to aid him, he would try. If successful, he
would surely become a Christian—and then his village
would be the one we had been hoping for to free itself
from the tribal bond, and become Christian.</p>

<p class='c009'>The experiment was, indeed, pathetic. Removing all
temptation, he began with a desperate determination
to succeed. We encouraged him with human sympathy
and the hope of divine aid. We pushed as far as we
dared the use of a tonic which Dr. McKean had given
me for such cases; and it aided him perceptibly. He
held out manfully for several days. But, at last, in an
evil hour, he could endure the torture no longer, and
before we knew it, he had resumed the use of the drug.
For two nights he had not slept. In his own expressive
language, it was not his eyes, but his heart
that could not sleep. Poor man! his sufferings must
have been as near those of the infernal regions as it
is possible to experience in the body. And then his
absolute wreck of mind, and the contempt he felt for
himself when he gave up the struggle as hopeless!</p>

<p class='c009'>We spared no labour to reach the homes of these
people, or their hearts. We tried to become Mūsôs to
the Mūsôs that we might win them. Sometimes we
had to sleep in their huts—on a floor raised two or
three feet from the ground, which the dogs shared
with the family, while the pigs and goats were on
the ground beneath. In the centre was a raised fireplace
on which the native teapot always boiled. Sleeping-mats
or thin bedding lay about on the floor, and
on this, before bedtime, some of the inmates would lie
down and fall asleep even while listening to the conversation.—But
everywhere the tribal bond was too
strong to be broken.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By this time the rains had set in. The trails—and
the leeches that infested them—were getting worse and
worse. Soon the torrent-streams would become impassable.
We must return while yet we could. Our
six weeks’ wanderings we retraced in four days of
constant tramping. It had been a hard trip for all of
us. I myself had a touch of fever. It seemed good
on reaching our camp to have once more the luxury of
a chair and a table. And then to be on the sadaw’s
back travelling homewards, and to meet a good mail
on the way! My three-score and fourth birthday was
spent in the forest, and I reached home safely
on the 18th of May, after an absence of nearly five
months.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The peninsula of Farther India is largely exempt
from the terrible scourge of famine which has become
almost chronic in Hindustan, its greater neighbour on
the west. There the population is so numerous that
the normal production of food is just sufficient to supply
its needs. Even a local or a partial failure of the
crops must produce distress. Siam, on the contrary,
is happy in that it not only produces an abundant supply
for its own people, but is a granary for the surrounding
countries. The worst that has ever been experienced
in Lower Siam in years of greatest scarcity,
has been the necessity of checking the export of rice.
The annual floods there cover the whole country, so
that a general failure of crops is, humanly speaking,
impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the northern states the land is higher; and considerable
portions of it, being above inundation, are
directly dependent upon the seasonal and local rains.
But with a population by no means dense, this very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>diversity of the cultivated areas is a source of safety.
A season of heavy rainfall which drowns the lowland
rice, is apt to prove exceptionally good for the uplands.
And, on the other hand, a season of light rainfall,
which cuts short the upland crop, is apt to be a good
season for the flooded areas. And in considerable sections
of the country there is the chance that a second
crop in the same season may make good the loss of the
first. There is a further security also in the fact that,
until communication with the coast becomes such as to
make exportation profitable, the excess of fruitful years
remains unconsumed in the country, to supply the need
of less fruitful ones. It thus comes about that scarcity
amounting to a real famine cannot result from the
failure of crops in any single year. It requires two
consecutive failures to produce extensive suffering
among the very poor, and three to result in a real
famine.</p>

<p class='c009'>This last, however, was the case in 1892. In 1890
there was a light crop throughout the land, with less
excess than usual to be stored. In 1891 the crop was
lighter still. In the eastern provinces, particularly in
Lakawn and Prê, there was very little rice to be reaped.
Famine conditions began there long before the time
for harvest. People were scattering off in squads or
by families into Chiengmai and the northern provinces,
begging a daily morsel. They were poverty-stricken as
well as famishing. The distress led the brethren in
Lakawn to make an appeal to friends in the United
States for a famine fund. Quite a liberal response,
amounting to several thousand dollars, was made to
this call, largely by the friends of the Lāo mission.
The relief was almost as timely for the missionaries
as it was for the famishing people. Otherwise they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>scarcely could have lived through the long strain on
their nerves and sympathies caused by the constant
sight of sufferings which they could not even in part
relieve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The province of Chiengmai could have met its own
needs until the new crop came in, had it not been for
the constant draft upon its reserves to meet the demands
of Lakawn and Prê. But, between high prices
offered and pity for the less fortunate, those reserves
were steadily drained away, until, during the latter
months of the year, famine was upon us in Chiengmai,
too. Bands of men from destitute villages, maddened
by hunger and unable to buy food, began to roam about
the country by night, or, sometimes, by day, and seize
rice wherever any little remnant of it could be found.
The authorities were powerless to restrain them or to
keep order. The condition of the more destitute provinces
can better be imagined than described.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the relief committee in Lakawn were asked
if they could not spare us a small portion of their
fund, for it seemed that their condition could not be
much worse than ours. A letter from Dr. W. A. Briggs
brought us three hundred rupees, but with the following
<i>caveat</i>—the italics are his:</p>

<p class='c024'>“<i>Wherever</i> we can reach the absolutely starving, that is
a place to invest. We do not pretend to relieve all the
<i>suffering</i>. Now, if the need in Chiengmai, or in the district
mentioned, is so great that people are actually dying
from starvation, and those now living are living on such
stuff as the sample enclosed (cocanut-husks, leaves, bark,
etc.), <i>with never a grain of rice</i>, then I would advise
you to form a Famine Committee, and go into the business
as we have done. The actual starvation <i>must</i> be attended to,
<i>no matter where it is</i>. But our saddest experience is within
Prê. Some one should be sent there at once.”</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>The scenes reported from Prê were harrowing. I
will not pain the reader by dwelling upon them. One
happy result followed the efforts of the brethren who
went to the relief of that district. While administering
to bodily wants, they preached the Gospel, making
such an impression that there was a strong demand
for a permanent station there—which was established
the next year, with Dr. and Mrs. Briggs as pioneer
missionaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be stated that, toward the last, the Siamese
government sent up supplies of rice; but, because of the
distance and the difficulty of transportation, not much
reached the suffering people in time to help them; and
much was lost in passing through the hands of so many
officials.</p>

  <h2 id='ch31' class='c010'>XXXI<br /> <br />CHIENG RUNG AND THE SIPSAWNG PANNĀ</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>At the Annual Meeting of the mission in December,
1892, the broad field of Tai peoples north of
the frontier of Siam was discussed, and Rev.
Robert Irwin and myself were appointed to make a
tour into that region as long and as far as in our
judgment might be deemed wise. The tour occupied
nearly five months—from January 3d to May 25th,
1893. This time we went fairly well supplied with portions
of Scriptures and tracts, and a good outfit of
medicine. Of quinine we carried a hundred ounces,
and returned with less than twenty-five. We relied on
the medicines for the welcome they never yet had failed
to win for us. And Mr. Irwin had a cornet which did
excellent service throughout the tour. For riding I
had my big “sadaw” elephant, and Mr. Irwin had a
pony; so we could exchange mounts at our convenience.
I pass over the earlier portion of our route, already
so often described, and the two weeks spent among
the hill-tribes visited on previous trips.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief object of our trip was to visit, in their ancient
homes, two northern tribes of the Lāo race—the
Kôn and the Lû—from which very many of our
parishioners in the southern provinces derived their
origin. For, under conditions which lasted very nearly
down to our own time, there was almost constant
predatory warfare going on in this northern country—stronger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>states raiding the weaker, and sweeping away
the entire population of the districts they overran, to
plant them in their own realms. Thus whole villages,
and even entire districts, in the Lāo provinces of Siam,
are peopled by the descendants of such colonies of captives.
We found it unadvisable to attempt both visits
in the same season, and the Lû were the more accessible,
living on the nearer slopes of the Mê Kông
valley. We went up on the west of the river along
the edge of the British territory, now known as the
South Shan States, and beyond it into Chinese territory,
as far as Chieng Rung;<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c020'><sup>[15]</sup></a> then, returning, we made
a somewhat wider sweep to the east of the river,
through French Indo-China; finally recrossing the
river at Chieng Lāp, where we struck once more our
outgoing trail.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f15'>

North being generally pronounced as <i>h</i>.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After leaving Mûang Len, the utmost point of a
former trip, we travelled awhile by a fine road along
the summit of a ridge so regular as to seem almost like
an artificial embankment, and affording noble views
over the valley. At Wieng Mai, a recent offshoot of
Mûang Yawng, we spent a most interesting Saturday
and Sunday. Here the Prince-Governor sent to ask if
he should not put up a sālā to shelter us during our
stay. In the morning we preached in the market-place,
and afterwards I distributed medicine and talked
with the people till noon, when I had to flee away to
rest under the shade of a big tree by the river. The
people seemed hungry for the bread of life. I could
not supply all the requests made for copies of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Yawng, the older and larger city, we reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>on Monday forenoon, after a two hours’ ride. An officer
met us at the gate, and showed us to the sālā.
When the Chao Mawm heard of our arrival, he sent
for us, meeting us at the door. We had a very interesting
interview, but he was not inclined to talk on
the subject of religion. He told me that the city and
district had been entirely depopulated in 1809 by a
force from Chiengmai, when “nothing was left behind
but the ground.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c020'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It had recovered itself, however,
and its population was now larger than that of Lampūn.
With Nān Suwan I visited the market and the
Court. At the latter place I learned that the British
Commissioner would arrive the next day. Knowing
that everything would be in confusion, we decided to
move on the next morning.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f16'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This incident is a striking illustration of the methods of warfare
in those days. The expedition in question was directed against the
Burmese, who had established themselves in Mûang Yāng some
sixty miles or more to the northwest. On its way it passed through
Mûang Yawng, where it was loyally received. But being defeated
at Mûang Yāng, it fell back upon Mûang Yawng, and there gathered
up all the inhabitants and swept them off to Chiengmai to prevent
their falling into the hands of the enemy!—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>From this point on, our elephant was everywhere an
object of great interest. Sometimes the people climbed
trees to get a better view of him. A long day’s march
brought us to Mûang Yū, picturesquely situated on
high bluffs, with deep gorges running down to the Mê
Lūi. Here we remained only overnight, leaving early
the next morning for Mûang Lūi, which we reached
about noon. That evening we had a large attendance
at worship, the governor and officials remaining till
after eleven o’clock. The original population of both
these districts, as well as that of Mûang Yawng, are
now scattered throughout the provinces of Chiengmai
and Lampūn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Next morning we crossed the beautiful stream on a
raft, while our elephant took the ford. During the
forenoon we came upon Captain Davis of the Commissioner’s
staff, who had been sent to make a detour by
Mûang Sing, and was then on his way to join his party.
He was resting by the roadside, ill with fever, and was
glad to get from me some quinine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following day, Saturday, brought us to Mûang
Lūang, the largest and most important place in the
valley and the southernmost of the old Sipsawng Pannā
confederacy. The valley population is wholly Lû.
There is scarcely a Ngīu (Western Shan) to be found
east of the Keng Tung watershed. Here were the best
roads we had seen anywhere in Farther India, with
a real arched bridge of stone across the stream at
the entrance to the city. Early next morning we were
awakened by a noisy crowd about our tent, anxious to
see us. It was the great market day, so, instead of
attempting a regular service in camp, we chose the
market-place. There, whether reading or speaking, we
always had some attentive listeners.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday our road lay for many miles along the
summit of a low ridge on which at intervals were
fifteen large villages, just at the edge of the long
fertile plain, where are the rice-fields that feed the
country. I never saw in all my touring anything quite
to equal that row of villages. It seemed too bad to
pass through so many without even stopping.</p>

<div id='i356'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>GROUP OF YUNNAN LĀO</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On the fourth day from Mûang Lūang we reached
Chieng Rung, the limit of our northward journey. Its
location is strikingly beautiful, on a high steep bluff
overlooking the Mê Kōng River, which sweeps in a
majestic curve about its base. It is in Chinese territory,
and is ruled by a Chao Fā appointed from Yunnan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>An officer from Yunnan was there at the time
collecting tribute. The influence of the English was
already felt there. Mûang Chê, to the west, had
rebelled against the Chao Fā, who thereupon sent out
an expedition which captured and brought away some
three hundred families of the inhabitants. But England
cannot allow border warfare to go on along her
frontier. An English officer appeared on the scene, and
the thing was stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Chieng Rung we were still in the midst of an
area of Lāo-speaking people—an area which extended
far beyond on every side. I gave a portion of Scripture
to a Lû whose home was ten days’ journey northward;
and others to men from as far to the east and to
the west.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had an interview with the Chao Fā by previous
appointment. At the door the officer suggested that
we pull off our shoes. We replied that it was not our
custom, and was unnecessary. He looked very doubtful,
but said no more, and we walked in. The Chao
Fā received us courteously. We took him to be a man
of no great strength of character, about forty years of
age, and somewhat weakened by the use of opium. He
asked whether we had not some antidote to enable him
to stop its use. He listened attentively to our statement
of the object of our coming, and said, “You are
merit-makers, and that is a good work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When we called at the court, the presiding officer
had a wise suggestion as to how we might further our
purpose and establish our religion in the place—a suggestion
evidently not originating with himself, but
from a higher source. “The favour of the Chao Fā,”
said he, “will be necessary and all-sufficient. I see
you have a fine elephant. Just make a present of him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>to the Chao Fā. He will be delighted, and your road
will be all smooth.” I told him that I was an old man,
far from home, and dependent on the elephant. So I
could not part with him. This same suggestion was
pressed upon us several times afterwards, by the highest
officials, and quite up to the hour of our departure;
though its form was modified from a gift to a sale. I
became at last a little anxious about the result, and
was somewhat relieved when we actually got away
without loss of the elephant.</p>

<p class='c009'>I may mention at this point an incident of this trip
which never came to my knowledge till thirteen years
later, showing how we were providentially spared from
what would have put a sudden and tragic end to our
tour and to our lives. When Dr. S. C. Peoples and
Dr. W. C. Dodd were in Keng Tung in March, 1907, the
presiding officer of the Court told them that he had
met Dr. McGilvary and Mr. Irwin on their way to
Chieng Rung; that when the people of Chieng Rung
first heard that some foreigners from the south were
<i>en route</i> to their capital, they planned to kill and
plunder them. But when they saw that the foreigners
rode elephants and were accompanied by carriers, they
decided that this was probably the advance guard of a
formidable army, which it might not be well to attack.
And then, he said, the kindness of the missionaries
so completely won their hearts, that all
thought of murder and plunder was given up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our return was to be through the region to the
east of the Mê Kōng. Its northern cities still belonged
to the Sipsawng Pannā. But the rest of it was
territory recently ceded by Siam to France. The governing
race—the people of the plains—were everywhere
Tai, speaking the Lāo language and using the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>Lāo literature. On its mountain ridges dwelt numerous
hill-tribes, especially the Kamu and the Lamēt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The route we were to take crosses the river two days’
journey south of Chieng Rung; so we had at first to
retrace our steps. We left the city on Monday, March
13th, safe from unseen plots, and with our elephant.
On the second day, after leaving our upward road to
strike across to the river, we entered unexpectedly a
large village, where we met with a reception ludicrously
hostile. At every door men were standing with guns in
their hands. We were surprised; but, supposing that
it might be muster-day or something of the sort, we
passed innocently along, without challenge, to the
monastery, where we dismounted and began to unload.
Then guns were laid aside and the head man and villagers
came up to see us and to offer assistance. They
had heard that foreigners were coming with elephants
and men, whether for peace or war no one knew. So
they had taken the precaution to be ready. When
they found out our peaceful errand, they were ashamed.
We had a pleasant visit and worship with them that
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next stage of our road was bad. In some
places we had to cut our way through, and there were
difficult passages of brook-beds and gorges. We
reached the river at Chieng Hā in a pouring rain, and
it rained again at night. The next day was the
Buddhist sacred day, and we were awakened early by
the crowd of merit-makers and worshippers—the
women and girls, as usual, in their head-dresses and
gay colours, and all anxious to see the elephant and
the white faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was 10:30 that morning before we got
away. Ourselves, our men, the saddles and luggage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>were carried over by the ferry. Nān Suwan alone
faced the deep river on the sadaw to guide him
through. At the first plunge all of the elephant save
his trunk, and half of the rider, went out of sight.
Thence on they went, now up and now down, till they
struggled out on the further shore. Such an effort is
very exhausting to the animal, and he has to have a
good rest and breathing-spell after it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Ham, on the eastern bank, is larger than its
neighbour on the west. Its governor was a Chao
Mawm, next in rank to the Chao Fā of Chieng Rung,
and his wife was the Chao Fā’s sister. I had a long
talk on religion with the wife. It was a new thought
to her that any one could be greater than the Buddha,
though he was neither Creator nor Saviour, but only a
man. It is unnecessary continually to state what was
everywhere the case throughout this trip; namely, that
we had good audiences and interested hearers. We
left in every place some books in the hands of those
most likely to use them; though we could have used
to advantage many more, if we had had them.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Mûang Ham two days’ march brought us on a
Saturday to Mûang Nūn, the most important city on
our route, and, therefore, a most desirable place to
spend Sunday. The city is in the valley of the Nam
Bān. It has well paved streets, and a very large
monastery on an eminence above, where we camped.
The abbot gave us a hearty welcome, and did all he
could to make us comfortable. At our night worship
the monks and other visitors were very attentive.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Sunday morning we called on the head officer of
the Court, and had a pleasant conversation with him,
for he was both intelligent and inquisitive. Just as we
were ready for our own morning worship, the Chao
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Mawm, a relative of the Chao Fā for Chieng Rung,
sent to ask us to call. We sent word in reply that it
was our hour for worship, and asked whether he would,
perhaps, like to have us worship in his residence. His
answer was a cordial invitation to come and do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prince was young and very pleasant. He had a
spacious house, and soon he had it filled with his
own family, his officers, and his people. Mr. Irwin,
as usual, had his cornet. We find that singing our
Gospel hymns, with a short explanation of their central
truths, is a better way to hold a mixed crowd
where women and children form a goodly proportion,
than is a regular service. Nān Suwan’s Lû dialect
served a very good turn. We had a very interesting
morning, and we were cordially invited to hold a
similar meeting at night, when many who had been
absent in the morning might attend.</p>

<p class='c009'>At night the house was crowded with a remarkable
gathering, for one could hardly call it a congregation.
The invitation, the place, the attendant circumstances,
were all unique. We sang and prayed and preached
with as little restraint as if we had been in our own
church in Chiengmai. The part of the service which
most impressed them was Nān Suwan’s prayer—a direct
appeal to a Person unseen, whom he addressed as
Father, Redeemer, Saviour, and Friend. Seldom have
I felt so strongly for any as for these, that they were as
sheep needing a shepherd; hungry souls asking for
bread, and getting that which satisfied not. Ethical
teaching they had in abundance, but no Divine Voice
asking, “Wilt thou be made whole?” or saying, “Thy
sins be forgiven thee. Arise and walk!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning we made our formal call upon the
Prince; but he sent to our camp for our books and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>the cornet, and soon we had another congregation, and
were having worship again. In the afternoon the
Prince made us a long call. Then there was a continuous
stream of visitors, mostly for medicine, and I
vaccinated a number of persons. The son of the chief
officer of the Court, a fine young man, was almost ready
to come with us to Chiengmai to study our religion
further. His father, too, was willing that he should
come. The young man promised that he surely would
do so next year, if we came again. And now, seventeen
years after these events, it saddens me to think no missionary
has ever been there since. An occupancy,
then, of those open Sipsawng Pannā States would have
turned the flank of French obstruction, and have ensured
an entrance from the north.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early on Tuesday morning we left Mûang Nūn, after
a visit all too short. The Prince, with his officers and
a large crowd of people, were on hand to bid us good-bye.
That day we found our track very much obstructed
by the jungle growth, and had some difficulty
in cutting our way through. Another complication
presently arose in the illness of my associate, Mr.
Irwin. An attack of indigestion developed next day
into symptoms of dysentery, which made further travel
for the time impossible. So we were laid up until the
following Tuesday at Mûang Wên—and anxious nights
and days they were. Milder measures failing, we had
to resort at last to a most heroic treatment which I
had seen used in the hospital, namely, large doses of
ipecac. By this means the disease was got under control;
and by care and dieting Mr. Irwin was able at
length to continue his journey on my elephant, though
throughout the rest of our tour he was far from being
well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>At Mûang Pōng, one of the three largest cities on the
route, we again stopped over from Thursday night till
Tuesday. Here I had an ague-chill on the night of our
arrival, but, with free use of quinine and a little rest,
I escaped further attack. There was a great deal of
fever in the place, and I spent much time in ministering
to the sick.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Saturday I called upon the Prince and his chief
officer. I was told that the city furnished five hundred
men for the Chao Fā’s expedition, and had seventy
villages within its jurisdiction. In former times it
had been raided by an expedition from Nān, and some
of the Nān villages to this day are peopled by descendants
of those captives.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday the Prince and his chief officer made us
long calls. The Prince had never seen a repeating
rifle, and seemed incredulous that it could fire twelve
shots in unbroken succession, till I fired three by way
of demonstration. His look of surprise was ludicrous.
He <i>must</i> have the gun, he said, to protect his country,
and began bidding for it. At last he offered a
fine riding pony, which I accepted. He was delighted,
saying that we two should always be brothers. If I
should never come again myself, he would welcome and
aid our assistants. Four years later I did visit the
place, but the Prince had been killed.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Tuesday we reached Mûang Māng, which proved
to be one of our most hopeful places. Sitting in front
of our tent, with the whole village about us, we talked
till midnight. I had a sore throat, but our assistants
were inspired with enthusiasm. At last we almost
had to drive the crowd away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Sing was the objective of this portion of our
tour. I first became interested in it when it was about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>to be occupied as a dependency of the province of Nān.
Mr. Phraner and I made an attempt to reach it in 1891,
but were turned back. Then, again, it seemed about
to fall into British hands, under some old claim by
Burma. Even at the time we were there, its status was
still uncertain. It gave evidence of having once been
a large city, and still had a very large territory under
its jurisdiction. Its earlier importance was reflected
in the title borne by its ruler, Chao Fā—Lord of the
Sky—a title borne by no other Lû ruler south of
Chieng Rung. My interest in Mûang Sing had been
deepened by acquaintance with a patient in the Chiengmai
hospital, of whose case Dr. McKean has kindly
furnished the following account:</p>

<p class='c024'>“This Prayā Singhanāt, a prominent man in the local
government, had been for years a great sufferer from vesical
calculus and had tried all kinds of remedies without avail.
Fearing his disease had been occasioned by offending the
spirits in the building of a new house, he tore the house
down. This gave him no relief. Although he had spent
years in the monastery, and had taken all the degrees of the
order, he concluded to re-enter it in the hope of being cured
of his malady, spending again six months in the monastery.
A travelling merchant who had himself been cured of calculus
by an operation in the mission hospital in Chiengmai,
advised the Prayā to go there for relief. This he determined
to do, not without great opposition from the Prince and
from his own family. But he was determined. He sold his
possessions, and started with 800 rupees. His journey was
long and painful. For weeks or even months at a time he
could not travel on account of great pain. Once he was
beset by dacoits at night. A part of his money and all his
guns were stolen. When he finally reached Chiengmai twelve
months after leaving home, he was penniless, and of course
still suffering intensely. He was received into the mission
hospital and was wholly relieved by an operation. A more
grateful patient one rarely sees. He regularly attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>service at the hospital and evinced great interest in
Christianity.”</p>

<p class='c025'>When we reached Mûang Sing, we were disappointed
to find that the Prayā was away. But he had loudly
sung the praises of the mission hospital, and that was a
good introduction for us. The chief officer of the Court
was a friend of his, and he proved to be a friend to us,
too. Hearing that we were come, the Chao Fā sent
for us, and turned out to be a relative of the great
Chao Fā of Chieng Rung. Though not of a nature so
deeply religious as some, he was interested in religion;
and our reply to his first question as to the object of
our visit, immediately introduced the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first he was inclined to cavil, asking such questions
as, whether Jesus could rise in the air as Buddha
did, and the like. But this was evidently to “save
his face” before his officers. For a while he maintained
that the universe is self-existent, having come
into being by the concurrence of the matter which composes
it. But presently he confessed that it is too
complicated for that, and plainly shows design—that
is, a mind or Mind. At last he asked what argument
made us foreigners so certain of our view that we
should come to ask them to change their religion for
ours. We told him that Jesus Christ Himself was the
all-sufficient argument. No matter how the world
came into existence, we are here, and we all know that
we are sinners. The Buddha confessed himself to be
only a man, and himself seeking a refuge like the rest
of us. Jesus Christ claimed to have come down from
heaven, and to be the Son of God. He challenged the
world to convince Him of sin. Those who knew Him intimately
saw something in Him not only different and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>superior, but of a different kind. He showed this not
only by His spotless life, but by the miracles that He
wrought. He claims to have power to forgive sins.
And thousands and millions who have accepted Him
believe that He has forgiven them; and show that fact
by becoming better men. We talked thus an hour
and a half. He evidently felt the force of the arguments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sunday was the fifth-day market or fair—the largest
and finest we had seen in the north. The hill-tribes, as
usual, were out in full force. I was still suffering with
sore throat, but Mr. Irwin and the assistants had a fine
morning’s work, and in the afternoon had a fair attendance
at the regular service.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most interesting incidents of our stay was
the night service, held in the residence of the Chao Fā
at his express request on the evening before our departure.
The audience was mainly his own family
and dependents, and the Prince was more free than
before. During the singing he asked that the cornet be
stopped in order that he might hear the words more
plainly. When Nān Suwan led in prayer, he wished to
know if we always prayed in that way. There was the
usual sad refrain—no hope of pardon, bondage to the
spirits, the drawing to a better way, but so strong a
counter-current! Yet who can tell how many, after
all, the truth may have reached?</p>

<p class='c009'>We left Mûang Sing on Wednesday, April 12th.
There is no need to weary the reader with details of
the ten days’ travel before we reached Chieng Sên,
or with the varied incidents of our work.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Chieng Sên we received letters that were disappointing
to my plans. The mission had unanimously
decided that, partly for considerations of our health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>and partly for reasons of mission policy, Mrs. McGilvary
and I should take our furlough at once. We had
been ten and a half years on duty in the field. My
wife was not really sick, but was not well, and the doctor
advised her going. I was very anxious to repeat
the same tour the next year, in spite of the few malarial
chills I had encountered this time. But arrangements
had been completed, and there was no option but to
submit.</p>

<p class='c009'>My companion on this tour was far from well, and
it was important that he should hasten home at once.
What with daily rains, bad roads, and swollen streams,
Mr. Irwin had a hard trip of it alone the rest of the
way; and it was some little time before he was well
again. For my return there was no such need of haste.
The work among the Mūsô had been left, upon the
whole, in hopeful condition. The power of the tribal
bond, which almost annihilated individual responsibility,
had been somewhat weakened. Many head men
had promised to enrol themselves as Christians this
season. It was certain that no tour among them could
be made the coming year. I must visit them now.</p>

<p class='c009'>The experiences of this visit were entirely like those
of the previous ones—everywhere the same warm welcome,
interesting night meetings, earnest consultations,
and ministering to the sick; days spent in wading
brooks, climbing mountain ridges, plunging down
ravines, to get from one village to another, where the
same round would be repeated. They would all become
Christians if only another officer or two would
join them. Thus it went on till we had visited nearly
all of the eleven villages, and were back at Sên Chai’s
and Sên Bun Yūang’s, where we began. These people
were nearer to Nān Suwan’s Christian village, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>known more of our religion, and, no doubt, were believers
in the truth of our teaching. We talked with
them till late at night, and our parting with them had a
tragic interest. They were apparently on the verge
of accepting the Gospel. We used our utmost endeavours
to persuade them to join Cha Pū Kaw on the
other side of the river, and not wait for the others
who might come in afterwards. This was probably my
last visit; but if any sufficient number would join the
church, the mission would not desert them. If not, in
all probability the offer would never be pressed upon
them again.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so it proved to be. About half of the villages
were under the governor of Chieng Sên. The inhabitants
of these were assured of their safety in taking the
decisive step, so far as the rulers were concerned. But
some of the larger villages were under the governor of
Mûang Len. His opposition was a foregone conclusion,
because of his interest in the opium traffic. My
failure to gain a large entrance among them was one
of the greatest disappointments in my whole work.</p>

<p class='c009'>That I was not mistaken in the hopefulness of the
work among the Mūsôs has since been demonstrated by
the many thousand converts won among the same tribe
by our Baptist brethren in the Keng Tung region. At
the same time they are better prepared for such a work
than were we. Their wide experience among the Karens
of Burma, and the large number of educated Karens
through whom they work, give them advantages in this
particular work which our mission does not possess.
On the other hand, it is surely to be regretted that our
mission should be limited in its access to all branches
alike of the Tai population found in the northern
states, for which, by identity of race and language and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>literature, we are far better prepared than our Baptist
brethren. For while, to use a legal phrase, the missionary
holds a brief for no one particular tribe; while
his commission and his duty is to preach the Gospel
to all whom he can reach; yet it is a well recognized
fact that the Tai family has largely fallen to our mission.
And it will be seen from what we have said
above, that we returned from this trip with enlarged
views and bright prospects of opening up work among
our own Tai people in the north. It will take years
of hard work and a useless expenditure of time and
money for any other missionary organization to reach
the point at which we were ready to <i>begin</i> work among
these people. But this is a complicated question, the
tangled web of which it is not possible for any one
man to unravel.</p>

  <h2 id='ch32' class='c010'>XXXII<br /> <br />THIRD FURLOUGH—STATION AT CHIENG RĀI</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>On my return to Chiengmai I found preparations
well advanced for our departure on furlough.
Embarking on June 7th, we reached Bangkok
on June 22d, and San Francisco on August 12th, 1893.
Of the events of that memorable year, I shall touch
upon only two or three.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. J. H. Barrows, the originator and President of
the Parliament of Religions, had invited me to attend
and participate in its meetings. After, perhaps, a
little shock at the boldness of the idea—as if Christianity
were to be put on a par with other religions—I
sympathized with the object as legitimate and proper.
It was merely doing on a large scale what we missionaries
are called upon to do on a smaller scale every
time that we hold an argument with Buddhists or
other non-Christian people. The fairness of the idea,
and even its very boldness, might do good; and I believe
they did.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the Sunday before the opening I listened to a
really great sermon by Dr. Barrows on “Christ the
Light of the World.” I attended every session of the
Parliament, save at the hour from 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to 12, when I
usually went over to the Moody meetings to hear John
McNeill, as he was familiarly called, preach his
trenchant sermons.</p>

<p class='c009'>If any one went to the Parliament—as possibly some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>did—hoping to hear Christianity demolished, he certainly
was disappointed. But there was one criticism
which occurred to me. Whatever may have been
thought of the wisdom of the original conception and
inauguration of the Parliament, the Protestant
churches might have made a much more imposing front,
if the ablest men of the different denominations had
not stood aloof, either indifferent or hostile to it. It
was surely the opportunity of a lifetime for many, who
could not hope otherwise ever to address personally
the votaries of non-Christian religions, to bring forward
their strong reasons to bear on so many of the
most intelligent and presumably the most earnest seekers
after the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>While attending these meetings in Chicago, I received
news that our son, the Rev. Evander B. McGilvary,
had felt himself constrained to resign from the
Lāo mission. No good can come from now reviewing
the issues which led to this step; and it is needless to
say how bitter was the disappointment to his parents,
who had looked forward to his carrying on their
work, and to him, who had specially prepared himself
for that work, and for no other. But I must say that
bitter as was the disappointment, I sympathized with
his position, and respected his motives.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the meeting of the General Assembly in the following
May, to which I was a delegate, the one all-engrossing
business was the trial of the Rev. Henry P.
Smith, D.D., for heresy on the question of the “Higher
Criticism.” Viewing the matter from this distance,
and entirely apart from the merits of this particular
case, I doubt whether critical and scientific questions
are proper subjects for trials before such a body. If
tried at all, such questions should be tried by a commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>of experts. Biblical criticism and science will
go on, and the questions involved will be decided according
to their own lines of evidence, quite irrespective
of the decrees of Popes, Councils, and General
Assemblies. I am much mistaken if the good
sense and temper of the church would now sanction
heresy trials on such questions.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>One day some fifteen years earlier than the point we
have now reached in our narrative, a letter came to
our mission from a Mr. Robert Arthington of Leeds,
England. The letter, like all his subsequent ones, was
on small sheets of notepaper, written over once, and
then written again crosswise, so as to be almost illegible.
The writer had somewhere learned of the
journey of a French explorer who, from the upper Mê
Kōng and the headwaters of the Mê Ū, had crossed
to the China Sea through the region now known as
Tonking. The traveller had passed through certain
tribes possessed of a written language and supposed
to be of Aryan stock. By some means Mr. Arthington
had heard of our mission, and wrote to enquire whether
some of us could not visit those tribes and distribute
among them “the Gospels of John and of Luke, and the
Acts of the Apostles,” particularly “telling them that
the Acts followed Luke, <i>and was by the same author</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We had not the slightest idea who the writer was;
but the devout spirit of the letter was charming, and
such interest in obscure tribes along the northern
border of our field was most surprising. His strong
desire to send the Gospel message to “the regions beyond”
appealed to me. He appeared to be a man of
means, for he offered to bear the expense of circulating
those three books. At the same time he was evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>somewhat eccentric and impractical in his ideas. He
seemed not to have thought that to circulate books
among newly discovered tribes would require—since
the cessation of the gift of tongues—acquisition of
their languages, translation, printing-presses, etc., etc.
But the case, at all events, seemed worth following up.</p>

<p class='c009'>I acknowledged the receipt of his letter, pointing
out the obstacles which he seemed to overlook, directing
his attention to our own mission as occupying a
new and interesting field, with many hill-tribes on our
own border which we hoped to reach. I invited his
coöperation, stating that as soon as we were properly
enforced, we intended to go as far north as we could.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost to my surprise, Mr. Arthington replied immediately,
expressing his interest in our work, but still
reverting to his scheme for evangelizing the “tribes of
Aryan stock” found by his French traveller. That
was, of course, impossible for us to undertake, though
I did propose to Dr. Cushing of the American Baptist
Mission in Burma to join me in a tour through that
region at Mr. Arthington’s expense. This plan had
attractions for us both; but Dr. Cushing’s college work
made it impossible. Still, we might be able to make
some compromise with our unknown correspondent.
So, for some years, I kept up an occasional correspondence
with Mr. Arthington, just sufficient to keep us in
touch with each other. He always replied immediately
to my letters, breathing the same deep interest in missions,
and especially in the tribes hitherto unreached
by the Gospel. Touring within my own appointed field
engrossed the whole of my available time; but since
that field was already in part supplied, it did not specially
appeal to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the tour, longer than usual, taken with my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>daughter in 1890, I sent him a report of it. In response
he sent me thirty pounds, which aided in the
work of 1891 among the Mūsô. The tour taken with
Mr. Phraner in 1892 was nearer to his idea; and the
one taken with Mr. Irwin in 1893 intensely interested
him—but chiefly because it seemed to be a stepping
stone toward reaching his “Aryan tribes” beyond. He
thoroughly approved of that tour; expressed his regret
that we could not meet in order to come to a
clearer understanding about the geography of the
region—since all our maps were defective; and suggested,
“I should like your daughter to go with you
on your next trip, as I can well conceive the idea that
she will be a valuable help.” He was, moreover, “particularly
interested that the Cambodians also should
have the Gospels of Luke and John, and the Acts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Following up Mr. Arthington’s suggestion of an interview,
I met him by appointment in Liverpool on my
return from the United States. We had only a half
hour’s interview; but he thought that sufficient to enable
us to understand each other’s plans. On reaching
London I was to make out an order for what sum
I needed for my next work. This I did, asking for the
modest sum of forty pounds, which I received by return
post.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trans-Mê Kōng tour, however, was inevitably delayed.
It was not until the Annual Meeting of the mission
in 1896 that Dr. Peoples and I were appointed to
make that tour, an account of which will appear later.
To complete, however, now the story of my relations
with Mr. Arthington, I may say that in advance of the
Annual Meeting just referred to, I wrote to him that
the projected tour would surely be taken, and suggested
that sixty pounds would probably suffice to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>cover its expense. His reply came the day before our
meeting adjourned, with a cheque for seventy pounds.
The timely aid seemed to anticipate the divine approval
of our attempt. In his letter he suggested,
“Perhaps it might be a good precaution for you to let
the French know your friendly object, and to get full
permission to travel east of the upper waters of the Mê
Kōng as far as you deem proper for your purpose.
But, dear Brother, seek—and I intend to ask with you—the
Lord’s counsel and blessed comfort and guidance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tour was taken, as I have already intimated,
and a full printed report was sent to Mr. Arthington.
On the whole, he was pleased; but it is not easy to
serve two masters. I had assured him from the beginning
that my first duty was to my mission and
my own field. Still he was a little disappointed that
I had to go so far out of my way to join Dr. Peoples
in Nān; and a little more so that we could not get up
nearer to Tongking to give his favourite “John, Luke,
and the Acts” to the tribes supposed to be of Aryan
descent, found by the French traveller. To enable me
to do this, he said, “I believe I should have great
pleasure in sending you all you will need from me.”
He even intimated once that he would be willing to
provide in his will for the continuance of that work.
While not jealous of my connection with the Board,
it seemed to him a tantalizing thing that, while I was
geographically nearer his goal than any one else, and
was, moreover, in sympathy with his devout spirit
and evangelistic aspirations to reach the “regions beyond,”
I was not free to carry out his favourite, though
somewhat chimerical, plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last letter I had from him was dated October
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>22d, 1898. His passion was then as strong as ever to
get his three favourite books to “the tribes mentioned
by the French traveller, ... for they are a people for
whom I have desired much, since the day I first read
of them, that they should have the Gospel.” He expressed
great sympathy with my disappointment that
the French would not permit our labouring in their
territory, adding, “Yet the Lord will not be robbed
of His own.” His death occurred not very long after
this. Of the disposition of his large estate I found
the following account in the London <i>Daily Graphic</i>:</p>

<p class='c024'>“The late Robert Arthington of Leeds, left about £750,000
to the London Missionary Society, and the Baptist Missionary
Society. The total value of his estate was £1,119,843.
It is estimated that the Baptist Missionary Society will
receive £415,000 and the London Missionary Society £335,000.
The whole of the money must be spent in the next twenty
years on new missionary work, and no part of it is to be
spent in the United Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c025'>We reached Bangkok on September 11th, 1894.
There we were joined by the Rev. and Mrs. Howard
Campbell and Dr. and Mrs. C. H. Denman, who had
come <i>via</i> the Pacific. Earlier in this same year there
had come to the station in Mûang Prê, Dr. and Mrs.
Thomas, Mr. and Mrs. Shields, and Miss Hatch; with
the Rev. and Mrs. L. W. Curtis and Miss Margaret
Wilson for Lakawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>On our arrival in Chiengmai we found Mr. Phraner
very ill with abscess of the liver, and suffering at times
intense pain. He had been warned by physicians and
friends to desist from his work and take his furlough.
But, as chairman of the Evangelistic Committee, he
had been pushing the evangelistic work too eagerly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>heed these warnings. He refused to leave his post
till those who were absent should return. Soon after
we arrived he started for the United States, but, alas!
it was too late. He died in Singapore on January
15th, 1895, leaving a wife and two little boys to pursue
their sad journey alone. Mrs. Phraner—formerly Miss
Lizzie Westervelt—had served a useful term in the
Girls’ School before her marriage. The Phraner
Memorial School for small children, erected by the
family and friends beside the First Church in Chiengmai,
is an appropriate tribute to their labours for the
Lāo race, to which they devoted their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>The year of our absence had been almost a banner
year as regards successful evangelistic work. Mr.
Dodd’s Training School had furnished a larger number
of fairly well prepared evangelists than we ever
had before. Between forty and fifty of these had been
actually at work in the field for longer or shorter
periods during the year, and their work had been very
successful. The Annual Meeting convened in Chiengmai
soon after our return. In it there was evident,
on the part both of missionaries and of native assistants,
a degree of enthusiasm and exuberant expectancy
which, under the most favourable circumstances,
could hardly have escaped the inevitable reaction.
Krū Nān Tā, a man of magnetic power among
his people, was then in his prime. The great value of
his services raised probably to an excessive degree our
estimate of the necessity of more <i>ordained</i> native labourers.
If one had done so much, what might a dozen
or a score accomplish? And there were the men, with
two, three, or even more years of training in the study
of the Bible. Most of them were elders or deacons in
the different churches. They had proved faithful in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>little. Why might they not be trusted with more
talents? Nine of these men were presented for examination
before the Presbytery.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we began, it was thought—against the advice
of Mr. Dodd, who was on furlough—that one or two
might be ordained to meet the immediate needs of
the work. Some of them had spent a number of years
in the Buddhist priesthood, and had some knowledge
of Pali. Others were without such education, but
nearly all had learned to read Siamese. In Biblical
knowledge they had made fair progress. When the
examination was closed, there was a long and anxious
deliberation, with special prayer for divine direction.
It was quite safe to ordain one or two. But the next
candidate was so near the standard of these that it
might seem invidious to exclude him—and so with the
next, and the next. When the vote was taken, six were
chosen for ordination and three for licensure. The
millennium seemed drawing near!</p>

<p class='c009'>With the new title and responsibility, higher wages
were naturally to be expected. And it was precisely
upon this rock that our hopes and plans suffered shipwreck.
The Board, as never before, began to insist on
the native churches assuming the support of their own
evangelists. The methods of mission work set forth
and practised in China by the Rev. Dr. Nevius were
urged upon us, and became very popular, especially
with the younger members of the mission, though in
China they had not passed beyond the stage of experiment.
They are best described in Dr. Nevius’ own
words:</p>

<p class='c024'>“These two systems may be distinguished in general by
the former’s depending largely on paid native agency, while
the latter deprecates and seeks to minimize such agency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>Perhaps an equally correct and more generally acceptable
statement of the difference would be, that, while both alike
seek ultimately the establishment of independent, self-reliant,
and aggressive native churches, the ‘Old System’
strives by the use of foreign funds to foster and stimulate
the growth of native churches in the first stage of their
development, and then gradually to discontinue the use of
such funds; while those who adopt the ‘New System’ think
that the desired object can be best obtained by applying
principles of independence and self-reliance from the beginning.
The difference between these two theories may
be more clearly seen in their outward and practical working.
The old uses freely, and as far as practicable, the more
advanced and intelligent of the native church members, in
the capacity of paid Colporteurs, Bible Agents, Evangelists,
or Heads of Stations; while the new proceeds on the assumption
that the persons employed in these various capacities
would be more useful in the end by being left in their
original homes and employments.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c020'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c022' id='f17'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Methods of Mission Work</i>, p. 4.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The result was that the mission took a good thing
and ran it into the ground. Economy became almost
a craze. The churches were assessed—not heavily, it
is true—to support the ministers; and the ministers
were exhorted to take whatever stipend was agreed
upon, and count any deficiency in it as a voluntary
contribution on their part, or as a debt they owed
their countrymen for the Gospel’s sake. Neither
parishioners nor workers understood the scheme. But
it was tried for one year; and at the next Annual
Meeting (in 1895) the catastrophe came. The churches
had been asked to walk before they could stand; and
the ministers were to work, as well as walk, by faith
and not by sight. As pastors, their expenses were
necessarily increased. They had to dress better, and
to be an example in clothing, and educating their families,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>and in hospitality. It seemed to them that they
were required to make bricks without straw. A little
yielding to demands that were not unreasonable would
have satisfied the ministers, and the churches would
have been encouraged by the continuance of some
support from the Board for evangelistic work, even
though the amount was much reduced. The zeal was
well meant; but we broke off too suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the unfortunate results, the mission, the native
ministers, the churches, and, indirectly, the Board
should share the responsibility. The advantages
gained by our Training School were nullified, and all
progress toward a permanent Theological School was
at an end. After those two Annual Meetings there
was no call for theological training, and no future
for a native ministry. So we have to go on appealing
to the Board and to the American churches for
foreign workers, although the salary of one of these
would support half a dozen or more native ministers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is easy to say that native ministers and church
members should be willing, out of pure gratitude, to
labour for the evangelization of their own people, or
that such and such other races have done so. As a
matter of fact, the Lāo church is largely indebted for
its progress to the power exerted by the church itself.
And as to the example of other races, we must remember
that there are racial differences. Even our
nearest Christianized neighbours, the Karens, stand in
a class quite by themselves in this respect. We can
no more apply one rule to all oriental races than we
can enforce western customs in the Orient. But we
certainly cannot expect happy results from the application
of rules that would have discouraged our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>own ancestors when the first Christian missionaries
found them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the things of more hopeful augury accomplished
in the year 1894, two deserve special mention—the
establishment of Christian Endeavour Societies
in all the Lāo churches, primarily through the efforts
of Dr. Denman, and the publication of the Book of
Psalms and of a hymnal of over two hundred hymns
and tunes. The Psalms were translated by Dr. Wilson,
and the hymns were almost wholly from his pen.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Annual Meeting, to which reference has already
been made, a committee was appointed to consider
anew and report on the question whether it was
or was not advisable now to occupy the northern
portion of the field with a permanent station, and, if it
were deemed advisable, to determine the location. I
had been anxious to have it occupied two years before
this time, but had yielded then to the claims of Prê
and of Nān—of Prê because the relief work among
the sufferers from famine had furnished a most auspicious
opening there; and of Nān because it was a larger
city and province than any in the nearer north. Notwithstanding
the greater progress of the work in the
north, with organized and growing churches in Wieng
Pā Pāo, Chieng Rāi, and Chieng Sên, there seemed to
be a lingering doubt as to the wisdom of establishing
permanent stations in cities so small as these. Most
of my colleagues had never visited that northern region.
No one save myself had surveyed the whole field. Yet
no part of the work of a mission is more important,
or requires better judgment, than the location of its
permanent stations. Although fully persuaded in my
own mind, I did not wish the mission to embark on a
new project involving outlay of money and of men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>without the mature judgment of the whole mission.
Hence it was at my own suggestion that the committee
was appointed.</p>

<p class='c009'>On January 20th, 1896, Dr. Denman and I of this
committee started northward. Mr. Dodd joined us
later. It is a great thing to have a physician along
on such a tour. He relieves a great deal of suffering
among a needy people, and so lifts a great load
of care from his companion. But beyond this, I myself
had quite an attack of fever on this particular trip,
and was much indebted to his care for my recovery.
Then we had the stereopticon along, and lectured
nearly every night to large audiences. The doctor
manipulated the lantern, and left the explanation and
application to me. Those pictures have made the
Gospel story to live in the imaginations of many thousands
of people. The occasional introduction of a
familiar scene from native life serves to give confidence
that the others also are real, while a few comic ones
interest the children, old and young. A picture of the
King of Siam—their King—with three of his children,
one of them with his arms about his father’s neck,
always attracted great attention, and was often asked
for again at the close of the exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had some trouble this time with my sadaw elephant.
At one stage his back became so sore that I
should have left him behind, were it not that he had had
a serious encounter with a tusker, and I dared not risk
him in that vicinity. He escaped from the encounter
with some bruises, and it was fortunate that he inflicted
no serious wound on his antagonist. And he
was quite well again, before we got home. This was,
however, the last tour he made with me. Elephants
had become property so unsafe that, before the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>season, I disposed of both of mine. In one year, out
of three hundred and fifty elephants employed by a
timber firm, thirty-two died and twenty-two were
stolen. But it was like parting with a friend to see
the sadaw go.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The committee visited the three northern churches,
and, after full conference both with the local rulers
and with the Christians, reached the unanimous decision
that there should be a station established in the
north, and that it should be at Chieng Rāi. In this
we were largely influenced by the central situation of
that place with reference to a considerable group of
cities and towns within the same watershed, and all,
like Chieng Rāi itself, rapidly filling up with an agricultural
population crowded out from the dear and
densely settled lands further south. And in addition
to this was the conviction that the new station would
prove a stepping-stone to the large northern section of
the Tai race, established in territory which is now English,
French, and Chinese. We still think that some
amicable arrangement should be made with the American
Baptist Missionary Union, by which the Tai race
to the north of Siam and east of the Salwin should be
left to our mission. The Union has a great work
among the hill-tribes—a work for which they are specially
adapted and specially well equipped; while we
are equally well equipped for work among the Tai.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Denman viewed the field with special interest,
for he had been designated to help in opening the station,
and we had the virtual sanction of the Board
thereto. It was the prospect of having a physician
that specially enlisted the interest of the rulers of
Chieng Rāi; though both they and their people were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>friendly to our work on other grounds. It made us
sad to think that our old friend the governor had not
lived to see the mission started. But the beautiful
lot given by him on the Mê Kok will always be a
memorial to him. In due time Rev. and Mrs. Dodd
and Dr. and Mrs. Denman moved up and opened the
station. The years have abundantly justified the wisdom
of this step. In 1910 the accessions to the
churches in Chieng Rāi equalled those of the mother
church in Chiengmai.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Chieng Sên we sent out two parties of evangelists,
five in each, well loaded with Scriptures and
tracts, one northwestward to Keng Tung, and the
other across the Mê Kōng to Mûang Sing. This was
the very first mission work ever done in the Keng Tung
State. These parties carried also a supply of medicines,
and were limited in time to two and a half
months. They were everywhere well received, and on
their return gave interesting reports of their work.
Their books were eagerly read, and the supply of them
was far too small. There were a number of interesting
cases of believers. Some villages were loath to
have them leave. The experiment, in fact, was very
successful.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>As soon as our committee work was done, Mr. Dodd
was obliged to return. After visiting the Mūsô villages,
Dr. Denman and I moved on to Chieng Kawng. This
town is situated on the right bank of the great river
within the fifteen-kilometer zone which was reserved
as neutral territory upon the cession of the left bank
to France. A French military station was on the opposite
side of the river, and a small gunboat was lying
there—the first that ever came up through the rapids.
Among the crew were two or three who could read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>English, and who were very anxious to get English
Bibles. This was an unexpected request which we
could not then meet. But I applied for some to the
American Bible Society, and received them just before
I started on my trip of the next year; and, finally,
was able to forward them to the men from Lūang Prabāng.
The captain of the gunboat was very kind to
us while we stayed at Chieng Kawng, and was much interested
in having his men get the Bibles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Letters were presently received by Dr. Denman summoning
him back to Chiengmai on account of the illness
of his wife. This left me again without an associate,
and with the added care of the medical work,
which cannot be avoided on such a tour, and which, of
course, rests more heavily on a layman than it does on
a trained physician. Before returning home I made
a call—and I believe it was the last one—at the Mūsô
villages beyond the Mê Kōng. Again my hopes were
raised of gaining the whole tribe. With such a prospect
I would gladly have remained with them several
months. But again I had to leave them with only the
“next year” promise—which never was fulfilled. I
reached home on May 5th, after an absence of three and
a half months.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>Two important tours were undertaken by the Lāo
Mission in 1897—one at the opening of the year,
eastward and northward beyond the Mê Kōng
River into French and Chinese territory; and the other
after the close of the rainy season, northward into
British territory. The latter tour led to far-reaching
results, but it does not come within the scope of this
personal narrative. The former was rendered possible
by the timely gift of seventy pounds from Mr. Arthington,
already mentioned; and represented the nearest
approach we could then make toward the fulfilment of
his great desire to reach with the Scriptures those
“tribes of Aryan origin” in the “regions beyond.”
Dr. Peoples, then of Nān, was my companion during
part of this tour; and we went well supplied with
Scriptures and tracts, no less than fourteen carriers
being loaded with these alone. I left home on January
12th, going eastward by way of Lakawn and Prê
to Nān, where Dr. Peoples was to join me. At each
of these stations I spent a busy and a delightful Sunday;
and from Lakawn as far as Nān I had the pleasant
company of Miss Fleeson and Miss Dr. Bowman, returning
to their post from the Annual Meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night on this portion of the trip we were
awakened by the cries of our men and the snorting of
the ponies, to find that we had a visit from a night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>prowler, coming so near that we heard the clatter of
the loose stones which he dislodged as he sprang away.
The tracks we found in the morning showed him to
be a large Bengal tiger. On this same stretch of road,
as recently as 1910, the mails for Nān were interrupted
by a man-eating tiger, which killed several men and
women, till, finally, he was despatched by Dr. Peoples
within a few hundred yards of the mission compound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten days were spent in journeying northward
through the great province of Nān, stopping night by
night in its villages and towns, where we always had
good audiences at our evening worship. Sunday we
spent at Mûang Ngôn, and then turned eastward, striking
the Mê Kōng at Tā Dûa, and making our way up
its western bank. At Bān Hūi Kûa we found such
interest that we were sorry that we must move on.
The Prayā—or Pīa, as the name is called throughout
this region—spent an afternoon in transcribing in the
Lūang Prabāng character the tract entitled “The Way
to Happiness.” He had heard something of our religion
before this from a former princess-pupil of Miss
Cole in the Wang Lang School at Bangkok. As he
bade us good-bye he said, pointing upwards, “I hope
we shall meet up yonder,” and seemed pleased that we
had the same anticipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Sunday we camped in the monastery
grounds at Bān Hūa Ling. The people began to assemble
before breakfast, and long before it was time
for the morning service the grounds were full. The
abbot, with his monks and the officers, sat directly before
me as I explained the method of salvation through
Jesus Christ. The audience listened most attentively.
At the close the abbot and the officers remained for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>further conversation. The abbot expressed surprise at
our errand. He had never known of anybody’s travelling
about simply to teach the people. Some expressed
fear of encountering the anger of the spirits
if they should no longer worship them. To this the
doctor gave the scientific answer that fevers and most
other diseases were caused and propagated by specific
germs, over which the spirits have no control whatever.
This was to them a new idea, but they seemed
to comprehend it. Next morning, when we left
them, the people followed us with expressions of regret.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we reached Chieng Mên, a town on the western
bank of the river and opposite Lūang Prabāng, we
found a European with a group of boys, who turned
out to be the French schoolmaster. He invited us
to dine with him that evening, and the next day aided
us in crossing the river. Our first duty in Lūang
Prabāng was to report to the French authorities, M.
Vackle, the Commandant Supérieur, and M. Grant, the
Commissaire. They had been notified from Bangkok
of our coming, and received us with genuine French
hospitality. We never met two more perfect gentlemen.
They even offered us a house; but, as the abbot
of the principal monastery was a personal friend of
mine, they yielded to our preference to stop with
him, but only on the ground that there would be more
comfort and room for our men.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening we were invited to dine with M. Vackle.
M. Grant and his staff were present; and the dinner
was a royal one, to which we were prepared to do full
justice. We had the embarrassment of not being able
to converse save through a native interpreter not well
versed either in French or in English. But our host
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>was most considerate, as were also his French guests.
And every evening during our stay we dined with one
or another of the officials.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day we called on the Lāo “King,” as he is still
euphemistically called, though possessing only such
powers as the French give him. When we made our
business call on the French officials to ask permission
to proceed on our missionary tour through the French
territory, they were very obliging. We freely discussed
together alternative routes, and they offered us passports
for any of them. When at last with some hesitancy,
the question of permanent work and a mission
station was broached, M. Vackle replied that for that
he had no authority. Application would have to be
made to the Governor General at Hanoi, and preferably
through Washington and Paris. The prospect
still seemed hopeful.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the evening before our departure, M. Vackle invited
us to dine informally and spend the evening with
him at his beautiful cottage and garden two miles
out in the country. On meeting us, our host said,
“The other night I was the Commandant Supérieur.
To-night I am simply M. Vackle. I want to have a
pleasant informal evening with you.” And surely we
did. We talked of the old friendship between France
and the United States, of Washington and La Fayette,
the Chicago Exposition, the Parliament of Religions,
and of M. Vackle’s own work in the new province.
He was interested in the Parliament of Religions, and
asked if Roman Catholics were equally welcome with
Protestants. He had an exaggerated idea of the number
of our religious sects. We told him that the great
body of Protestants were included in five or six groups
somewhat like the orders of the Catholic church, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>there were numerous smaller subdivisions. He had
heard of one that lived wholly on milk. Of this we
had to confess ignorance, unless it were that large
group that we call infants.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after eleven when we rose to take our leave;
and even then he detained us to see by torchlight his
beautiful garden, artificially watered, and his bowling
alley—insisting that we try a turn on it. This was
what I had never done before, but at the first bowl I
brought down several pins. This pleased him, and he
said that he had never seen a better first play.</p>

<p class='c009'>On taking our final leave, we spoke a last word for
permanent mission work, reminding him that while
Catholicism and Protestantism had alike produced
great nations, Buddhism never had; and that it was
therefore political wisdom to encourage and foster
the Christian religion in the provinces. He assented,
but said he feared that the “King” might imagine
that his subjects would be less loyal if they became
Christians. We assured him that the reverse would be
true, since it was a fundamental point in our teaching
as well as in the Scriptures, that Christians were to
be obedient to their rulers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the routes offered we chose the northern one
as most nearly meeting Mr. Arthington’s desires. Our
passport stated that we were Bāt Lūangs, i.e., Catholic
priests. We left Lūang Prabāng on Monday,
March 8th, crossed the Nam Ū near its mouth, and
spent three weeks on our way to Mûang Sai. At one
point there was a theft of a considerable amount of
our money, which delayed us a day or two, but annoyed
us more. The thieves turned out to be some
of our own men, who afterwards confessed, and eventually
we recovered the money. From Mûang Sai there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>is a good route to Nān, and as no man had been left
in that station along with the ladies, Dr. Peoples felt
that he must return to it, while I should go on northward
to the Sipsawng Pannā and finally return to
Chiengmai along the route which I took with Mr.
Irwin in 1893. His departure was a great loss to me
personally, and to the effectiveness of the tour. He
left us on March 31st.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next week was one of intense interest to me.
One of its days was the thirtieth anniversary of my
arrival in Chiengmai, and fraught with memories of
the hopes, achievements, and disappointments of all
those years. And were we now, perhaps, on the eve
of a new opening with wider possibilities than ever?
So it seemed. For, one day as I was in the monastery
at Mûang Sai, there entered an officer, Sên Suriya by
name, who, making the obeisance usually made to
priests, explained that, having been absent from home,
he had not heard the instruction we had given at our
evening worship. His wife, however, had reported that
a teacher from a great and distant country was come
with Scriptures and an offer of salvation from the
great God of all. It was the great desire of his heart
to be saved from his sins. His interest was evidently
intense, and that roused our interest in him. From
three o’clock till nightfall our elders and I explained
to him the great truths of revelation, while he listened
almost with rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of this earnest conference the “āchān,”
or chief officer of the monastery, came in; and Sên
Suriya joined us in explaining to this friend the
strange news he had heard. The āchān was soon as
deeply interested as he. He also desired to know
further of this matter. Before we parted that evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Sên Suriya had accepted the teaching joyfully; and
his friend, with more reservation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon others had joined these two—notably a family
of refugees from persecution for witchcraft. They
were ready to accept anything which would deliver
them from bondage to the spirits. On Sunday at the
public service the instruction was directed to the needs
of these enquirers, all of whom were present. The cost
was to be counted; the cross was to be taken up; but
the reward was great. Sên Suriya’s wife and family
all opposed him. He had spent an anxious night, and
was under great strain; but was still firm. He was
ready at any cost.</p>

<p class='c009'>His friend the āchān had received his appointment
in the monastery from the Pīa, or head-officer. For
honesty’s sake he felt he must notify the Pīa and resign
his position. It was, therefore, arranged that our
elders and I should go with the two friends on that
errand that very afternoon. We went, and were kindly
received. Sên Suriya, as spokesman, witnessed a good
confession. They had been men, he said, who all their
lives had sought merit and followed the teachings of
the Buddha, but with great anxiety, on account of their
failures. Now they had learned of the great refuge of
the God who could pardon and save both in this and in
the coming world. Their motive was strictly religious.
They would be as loyal as ever, and would perform
faithfully their government duties. The āchān said
that his friend had fully expressed his views, but he
wished further to resign his position in the monastery.
The Pīa listened with evident interest, but with some
surprise. When he spoke, he said: “All that I know
of religion I have learned from these two men. They
know manifold more than I do. If they see it right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>how can I oppose? I will still take them as my religious
teachers, and will learn Christianity of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I added a word, emphasizing their assurance that
being good Christians would only strengthen their loyalty.
Thanking the Pīa for his kindness, I retired.
How much of his liberality was due to my presence—if
it were so due at all—I do not know. But next
morning Sên Suriya came to say that he could not
withstand the opposition of his wife and family. While
his faith was firm as ever, he could do no more this
year. By another year he hoped their opposition might
be relaxed. Meantime the family of refugees had
weakened. I supplied all these with medicine, and
urged them to remain steadfast in the faith, reminding
them that baptism was not essential to salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had made further stay in Mûang Sai dependent
upon the outcome in the case of these two men. So
now it seemed best to continue my journey northward.
I went out to a retired wooded hillock, and there spent
a quiet season in prayer, commending those in whom
I had become so intensely interested to the care of
the Divine Teacher, and seeking direction for my
further course.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far we had not met many of the hill-tribes, which
had been one of the main objectives of the tour. As I
descended from the hill, I found some thirty Kamus
just arrived on some government work, and encamped
by the road. I turned aside to speak with them, when,
to my surprise, one, taller and more intelligent than
the rest, answered me in good Lāo. To my greater
surprise, when I handed him a tract, he began to read
it. It seems that, when a lad, he had been initiated into
the monastic order by the Princess of Lūang Prabāng,
and was one of the very few of his tribe who was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>fairly good Lāo scholar. He was delighted to get the
book; but I was like a miner who has found a new
gold mine. Had they been ready to return to their
homes, I should at once have gone with them. A new
vision seemed to open before me of work among that
interesting tribe. I had seen the great value of the
help afforded by Cha Pū Kaw, the first Mūsô convert,
in work among his tribe. But he was not a scholar,
and was too old to learn. Here was a Kamu scholar.
Might he not have been raised up for this very purpose?</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening I spent with my elders in their camp.
I left with my new friend a number of books, which
he promised to read to his people. I took down the
names of their villages, and promised if possible to
visit them next year—which they all begged me to do.
That apparently casual meeting seemed to me a loud
call, Come over and help us! And it led to a most interesting
work, which was stopped only at the command
of the French.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Mûang Sai, we journeyed northward along
the telegraph road, enlivened by noble views of long
slopes, deep gorges, and high peaks. We passed some
villages of the Yao tribe with whom we could converse
only by signs. On the third day out, at Bān Nā Tawng,
we left the telegraph road, turning off at right
angles to Mûang Lā. At one village the head man
assembled his people to meet us, when he learned that
here was a man from seven days beyond the great
French country! At one place we passed a village of
Lentīns, so named from the district in Cochin China
from which they came. They showed their Chinese ingenuity
by having their rice-pounding done by water-power.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Āi was the last town in French territory; beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>it one enters the province of Yunnan, China.
Here we had scarcely pitched our tent before the governor
had read our little tract on “The Way to Happiness,”
and asked us to stay awhile to teach his
people. This we did, remaining from Friday till Tuesday.
He invited us to worship in his house, which was
filled to overflowing. On Saturday, in company with
the governor, I attended a wedding feast. I got along
finely with the various dishes until a bowl of blood
fresh from a slaughtered hog was passed around, and
each guest took a spoonful! My note upon leaving the
town was, “It is wonderful how many, especially of
the officers and the more thoughtful class, are struck
with the self-evidencing truths of the Gospel on its first
presentation. And their first thought is the sincere
conviction that the Gospel meets their wants. Nor is
this testimony invalidated because, when they come to
count the cost, they are not willing to pay it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was much pleased to hear uniform testimony to
the uprightness of French officials. My own respect
for French rule had greatly increased since we entered
their territory. Is it that the Tai race beyond
the Mê Kōng is more religious, or is it on account of
the French rule, that people there seem more deeply
interested in the Gospel message? But such has been
the fact. I have never been cheered by brighter visions
of hopeful and speedy results of our labours. It seems
almost inconceivable that a European nation should
forbid missionary work among its people.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this point on we were warned not to allow our
party to be separated on the march. Shortly before
this a merchant travelling with his son had been attacked
and killed. I heard of two mountain tribes in
this neighbourhood new to me, and of a third further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>to the northwest, which sacrifices at every rice-harvest
a human victim captured from some other tribe.
Scarcely any one had ever heard of the name of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not far from the town we passed on a ridge a well-marked
boundary stone with the letters R. F. (République
Française) on one side, and C. R. (Chieng
Rung) on the other, in large Roman capitals. Noticing
by the roadside a large stack of bricks, we learned
that we were near the salt wells, and that the salt was
compressed into bricks for easier transportation on
mules. The salt industry makes Bān Baw Rê an important
place. No one with white clothes, white hair,
or white beard is allowed to enter the enclosure about
the salt wells; so I did not see them. I could get no
reason for the prohibition, save that the spirits would
be displeased.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time of my visit was unfortunate, being the beginning
of their New Year festival, which is always a
season of carousal. That night we had a scene that
defied description. After supper a man came to tell
me to get ready; they were going to “saw” me. I
did not know what “saw”-ing might be; but I soon
learned, to my disgust. Presently a noisy crowd entered
the sālā where I was, with drums, fifes, and other
musical instruments, and surrounded me with deafening
noise and songs. A great personage had come to
their place, and they were come to do him honour.
He had great riches, and they expected a treat of fifty
rupees. Paying no attention to my attempted disclaimer,
they went on: “Give us out your money.
Give us fifty rupees! Give us twenty-five!” Pushing
my way out of the noisy circle, I was followed with
more imperative demands. At last the governor’s son
came up as a friend and advised me to give them five or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>six rupees, or they would never depart. Then one of
my elders came to me, anxious regarding the outcome,
and said that it was only a New Year custom, not a
religious one—intimating that I need have no conscientious
scruples in the matter. Finally the governor’s
son said he could get them off with three rupees.
I had only one in my pocket, and did not dare open
my box before that mob. At last I handed the young
man that one, and, with an emphasis which they understood,
told him that I would give no more, appealing
to his father for protection, and holding him responsible
for the consequences. They went off sullenly
enough. Having gone so far, I doubt whether they
would have desisted without something “to save their
face.” From me they went to the governor’s, and so
on, in order, throughout the place, with their hideous
noise, which I could hear far on into the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>At another village further on, the people seemed in
doubt how to receive me, till a young man came forward
and asked if I were not the man who a few
years before travelled through that country with an
elephant, and let the Prince of Mûang Pōng have a
gun. Then, turning to the head man, he said, “You
need not be afraid. He is a teacher of the Jesus-religion.”
My standing in that village was assured.
One of the listeners at our worship in the monastery
that night was much impressed, not with the idea of
pardon, as is commonly the case, but with that of the
Holy Spirit to purify and cleanse. That was what
he needed; and he earnestly enquired how to obtain
his aid. This led to the subject of prayer to a living,
personal God, who has promised this aid. We left him
with the hope that his great need would be supplied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mûang Lā was the furthest point reached on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>tour. From it we struck westward into our old route
of 1893 at Mûang Pōng. The Chao Fā who got my
gun had been killed by his people. I was much struck
with the judicial aspect of the act as told me. One
of the officers said, “He was a bad man, who oppressed
the people, fined and executed them unjustly,
and, of course, we killed him. That is the way the Lāo
do.” A nephew and adopted son of the murdered
Prince succeeded him, but the authority was largely in
the hands of the Prayā Lūang, though the young
Prince’s mother also had great influence. She invited
me to a good dinner, and we had a most interesting
conversation. Among other things she asked, “How
is it that you say Buddhism cannot save?” and she
seemed much impressed with the answer: “Because
Gautama Buddha is gone, and it is more than twenty-five
hundred years before the next Buddha is expected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We were now travelling southward, and soon came
once more upon the tricolour floating over the French
post at Mûang Sing. I felt like saluting it. I was
greatly surprised to find an Englishman, Mr. Eva, in
charge. He fairly shouted to hear his mother tongue
once more. He had scarcely heard a word of it for
three years. Seeing that I was spent with my long,
hot ride, and that my carriers would not get in till
nightfall, he kindly offered to hunt me up some
luncheon. This I declined, if only I might have a
cup of tea and a piece of dry bread. Holding up both
hands, he exclaimed, “You’ve got me there! I’ve almost
forgotten how wheat bread tastes.” He insisted
on my taking up my quarters in his bungalow, till I
said, “If you were on French business, you would
wish to stop where you could best accomplish it, would
you not? I am here on missionary work, and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>business is with the people. The monastery grounds
will suit me better.” “Looking at it in that light,”
said he, “you’re right. I’ll say no more.” I knew
that in the home of a French official I should have no
visitors at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was the son of an English Wesleyan minister;
but, being a wild lad, he had wandered away and
drifted into the French army, where he rose to an official
position. But the influences of his early days
had not been lost. We had many heart-to-heart talks
together. He wanted an English Bible. Having only
my “Oxford” along, I could not spare him that, but
brought him one on my next tour. On Sunday he attended
the service led by the elders, pleased at the
evidence they gave of the reality of our missionary
work. He had six thousand Kamus in his district.</p>

<p class='c009'>The opium habit is very common. We found but
few monasteries in the Sipsawng Pannā whose abbots
and monks did not use opium. One man, when asked
whether he used it, made a significant answer: “When
I have money, I do. When I have none, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chao Fā of Mûang Sing was busy preparing for
the marriage of his daughter with a son of the great
Chao Fā of Chieng Rung. So I did not see much of
him. I had a long talk, however, with the prospective
groom. He doubted the possibility of pardon for sin.
I had several interviews with Dr. McKean’s patient
for calculus, before mentioned. He was not so near
Christianity as I hoped to find him, but was profuse
in praise of the doctor and the hospital. He had two
wives before the operation, and now was utilizing his
new lease of life by taking another younger one. I
saw here some peaches not quite ripe—which was very
tantalizing. But I did get some ripe plums.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>When I left Mûang Sing on April 28th, Mr.
Eva escorted me six miles on my way, and we
bade each other good-bye four or five times before we
could finally part. At Wieng Pūkā I had another
warm welcome from the French Commissaire. I had
to decline his invitation, also, to good quarters
with him; but dined with him at night, and
next morning he sent me a nice shoulder of beef. A
large number of Kamus were here engaged on some
public works. Unlike most of their tribe, these are
Buddhists, and there were a number who could read,
and who were delighted to get books. It was remarkable
that their women spoke Lāo fairly well. Their
chief officer had eighteen hundred men under him.
After talking with them till near midnight, I turned
them over to the elders, and was soon asleep. Next
morning my cook came to my tent to enquire whether
I were not ill. It was half-past six, and breakfast was
ready!</p>

<p class='c009'>We passed many Kamu villages in this portion of
our route. Most of them would welcome a missionary,
and seemed ripe for the Gospel. Formerly, under the
government of Nān, they had an easy time, with no
taxes and almost voluntary service. Now they naturally
complained of the stricter régime of the French.
I consoled them with the fact that the world over
people have to pay taxes to the government that protects
them. For this I did not at all need the warning
which Mr. Eva gave me, that the one thing which
the French would not tolerate was interference with
their government work. At Chieng Kawng I took
leave of French territory, with nothing but feelings of
gratitude for the uniform personal kindness of their
officials, and their apparently kind interest in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>work. That work I must now dismiss with the very
brief outline I have given. I believe that light was
conveyed to many seekers after truth, and seed was
sown which will not be lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Chieng Kawng onwards I was on old touring
ground, and among friends. I spent a Sunday there,
made a short visit to the Mūsô hills, and found a warm
welcome in Chieng Rāi from the two missionary families
who were now established in that station, as well
as from my many native friends. Here I received my
long-desired mail. Its good cheer was tempered by
one sad piece of news—the death of my sister Mary
and my brother Evander, the last of my own mother’s
children. On May 16th I entered upon my own three-score
and tenth year. Leaving Chieng Rāi on the 18th,
I reached home on the 26th, after an absence of four
and a half months.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the work in our own and in all the
other stations had been energetically prosecuted by a
faithful band of younger workers, better prepared than
the old ones to carry it on to completion. And the
other long tour to the English territory, planned for
the later portion of the year, was successfully carried
out by Dr. Briggs, Rev. Mr. Dodd, and Rev. Mr. Irwin.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>
  <h2 id='ch34' class='c010'>XXXIV<br /> <br />THE CLOSED DOOR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The tour of 1898 was undertaken with two special
objects in view: (1) to follow up the
auspicious beginnings of work among the Kamu
and Lamēt tribes, the largest and most important
within the mountain area explored during the previous
season, and, apparently, ready as a body to accept
the Gospel; and (2) to secure the sanction of the
French government for continued work in French territory.
I was unable to secure a missionary colleague
for the tour, and therefore went accompanied only by
native evangelists. I took the most direct route, crossing
the Mê Kōng at Pāk Bêng, following the Bêng
River to its source, and crossing by the pass at its
head to Mûang Sai, the point at which the most
promising work of the previous tour was begun. The
journey so far occupied nearly a month’s time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tour was organized on notice too short to permit
my passport from the United States Minister in
Bangkok to reach me in Chiengmai before I started.
It was, therefore, sent on direct to the French authorities
at Lūang Prabāng. Meantime M. Vackle, the
Commandant Supérieur, who was so kind to us the
year before, had been superseded by M. Luce; and him,
unfortunately, we just missed at the crossing of the
Mê Kōng. He passed up in a steamer the day before
we reached the river. By the time we reached Mûang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Sai, M. Luce had returned to Lūang Prabāng, and had
wired to the office in Mûang Sai that my passport
was come, and that I was expected in Lūang Prabāng.
No instructions were given regarding my work, and
the authorities were in doubt what to do. Under the
circumstances, the only passport they could issue was
one to the capital, Lūang Prabāng.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were not particular, however, as to the route
I should take. So I chose a circuit to the northeast,
leading through the mountain region to the Ū River,
down which I could descend by boat to Lūang Prabāng.
This would enable me to find Nān Tit, the Kamu
scholar whom I met at Mûang Sai on my previous
tour, and to visit with him a few Kamu villages. The
extent of the work I hoped to undertake that season
would depend upon the opening I found there. A passport
was given me by that route, and a soldier was sent
along as guide and escort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nān Tit, as I hoped, had read the books I gave him,
had prepared the way for me by teaching the substance
of them to his neighbours, and now would assist
me in teaching his tribe. With him as interpreter
and assistant we visited a number of contiguous villages,
holding night conferences, at which the whole
population of the village would be present. Everywhere
a wonderfully ready response was given to the
Gospel. They, too, were oppressed by the dread of
spirits, and welcomed deliverance from their bondage.
They would accept the Gospel, but, naturally, referred
us on to the Pīa.</p>

<p class='c009'>To his village at last we went. He was a venerable
man near seventy, and though for years hopelessly
crippled by paralysis of the lower limbs, his bright
mind and business talents had raised him to his present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>position, and given him a commanding influence. I
shall never forget our first interview. He had heard
the rumour that our religion could overcome the spirits
and save from sin. Crawling painfully on his hands to
meet us, he welcomed us to his village and his people.
He had heard of the Jesus-religion, and wished to
embrace it. Since he was old, he must do it soon.
This was on Friday afternoon. By Saturday night
every family in the place had made the same decision,
and would begin by keeping their first Sabbath next
day. Our elders entered with heart and soul into
teaching them. The young folks soon learned a verse
or two of “The Happy Land,” and some a verse or two
in the Catechism. Next morning, before I was dressed,
old and young of both sexes were gathering to learn
how to keep the Sabbath. It was a great day, just the
like of which I had never seen. It settled the decision
of hundreds, possibly of thousands, of people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still, everything depended upon the French authorities.
They could forbid our teaching, as, in fact, they
afterwards did. But up to this point I could not believe
that they would. A prompt and candid interview
seemed all that would be necessary to settle that
matter, and make the Kamus feel safe. If such an
opening were found, I had determined to remain with
them throughout the season. But in that case my
family and the mission must be informed. More medicine
and books and some comforts would be required to
carry me through. It was, therefore, decided to move
on a day’s journey to Mûang Lā, a convenient point,
leave there two elders to instruct the people, and send
back three carriers to Chiengmai for the needed supplies
and another elder; while I went on overland to
Mûang Kwā, and there took boat down the Ū River.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>The mountain scenery along this river is very beautiful,
especially so near its junction with the Mê Kōng.
We reached Lūang Prabāng on Monday, May 9th, and
called at once on M. Grant, who was so kind to us the
year before. He gave me a greeting as warm as ever.
The king was having an interview with M. Luce that
day, so I could not see him till Tuesday. I dined that
night with M. Grant, he himself coming at dusk to
walk over with me. We had a delightful evening.
There had been a regular exodus of Kamus that year to
Chiengmai and other southern provinces. M. Grant
asked if I had heard any reason assigned for it. I told
him that I had heard of three—the dearness of rice,
owing to the failure of the last crop; the exhaustion
of the mountain lands, and the lack of remunerative
employment by which they could earn the money required
to pay their taxes.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Tuesday afternoon the Commandant Supérieur
sent his secretary to invite me to an interview. He,
too, gave me a cordial greeting. He had received my
passport together with a letter of introduction from
the Consul Général in Bangkok. I had also a kind
personal letter from our United States Minister, Mr.
John Barrett. He had used his personal influence, and
assured me that it would all be right. My interview
was very pleasant. M. Luce enquired about our mission
work, the number of our converts, and other similar
matters. He then referred to the large emigration
of Kamus; asked if I had heard of any reason for
it, and how many of our three thousand converts were
Kamus. He was much surprised to learn that the
converts were almost entirely Lāo, with not a half
dozen Kamus among them. Putting his anxiety about
the emigration and our work among these people together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>it seemed to me later that he must have
thought the movement a religious one.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, at last, I stated my special errand to the
city, namely, that a number of villages in his province
were interested in our religion, that I wished to teach
them further, and that, since they were French subjects,
I thought it proper to inform him and secure his
sanction, he thanked me for doing so, but his manner
at once changed. He said he should have to consult
the king about that; the mountain people were
hard to teach; the country was unhealthy; the Catholic
missionaries in the south were leaving, or had left; the
king would fear that the Kamus would become disloyal
to him if they became Christians. To this I replied
that the native officials had uniformly granted us permission
to teach among their subjects; that they
realized that it was a benefit to their country, and
even gave us their assistance; and that it was the fixed
policy of our mission to teach Christians loyalty to
their rulers. M. Luce said he would consult with the
king, and would let me know the decision. I expressed
my wish to pay my respects to the king, which he said
was a very proper thing, and, on my leaving, he gave me
a cordial invitation to dine with him that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day, through M. Grant, I secured a very pleasant
interview with the king. My long residence in the
country and acquaintance with both Siamese and Lāo
officials, gave us much common ground for conversation.
He was pleased that I had known their
Majesties, the present King of Siam and his father, his
former liege-lords. Quite in line with native ideas,
he thought I must be a man of great merit to be so
old and yet so strong. I explained at his request the
teaching of our religion, pointing out some of its distinctive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>differences from Buddhism, in all of which
things he was interested. He said that it was all very
good, but he was born and reared in the Buddhist worship,
and was too old to change. Gradually introducing
my errand, I told him of my interest in the Kamus,
and of their desire to become Christians; that I had
come down to get permission to work among them.
We taught them a better morality, of which loyalty to
rulers was a fundamental article, enjoined by Jesus on
His disciples. He raised the objection that the Kamus
were ignorant, and we would find them harder to teach
than the Lāo. To this I replied that these villagers
had become believers, and I was going to spend several
months in teaching them. He asked if I did not think
I was running great risk in living so long in the forest,
and so far away from home. “Well,” said I, “I am
used to life in the forest and jungle, and you can see
for yourself how I have fared.” At which he smiled,
and made no further objection. I left with the firm
conviction that if M. Luce were not unwilling, there
would be no difficulty with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>While at dinner that night, I informed M. Luce of
my pleasant audience with the king; how I told him my
plans, and he had virtually given his consent. “Is
that so?” said he. “I must see the king myself about
that.” And as I took my leave, he said again, “I will
see the king to-morrow, and will let you know the
result.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next afternoon, Thursday, M. Luce had a long
interview at the Prince’s residence. On Friday afternoon
I called on M. Grant on my way to the Commandant’s
office. He told me that M. Luce wished to
see me, but had instructed him to notify me that the
king did not understand that I was to spend several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>months among the Kamus—though he certainly did,
or why should he have raised the question of my
health? I reminded M. Grant that my passport was
not to the king, but to the French authorities. All
the world recognized the country as French territory.
It would have been considered a discourtesy to the
French if the representative of the United States had
sent a letter to the Lāo king as such. He admitted
that in a limited sense this was true; but they did not
treat the king as a conquered vassal. Cochin China
had fought the French, and had been conquered and
annexed. But Lūang Prabāng had put itself under
their protection without firing a gun. M. Grant delivered
his message with as much consideration toward
my disappointment as was consistent with loyalty to
his superior. But my disappointment I could not
conceal.</p>

<p class='c009'>M. Luce, I was informed, was very busy that day,
but would be glad to see me on Saturday afternoon.
The decision, however, was irreversible. Further
pressure would be useless, and might be unwise. In
that case, I said, of course I must submit. I had
shown proper respect for the ruling authority, and my
own desire to avoid future misunderstanding, by making
the long and costly journey to Lūang Prabāng.
My errand was now ended. I would take my leave
at once, and return next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>This being reported to M. Luce, he sent word that
he must see me before I left. I might come immediately.
Personally, again, he was very kind, but made
a studied effort to put the responsibility upon the
king, who, as he said, had not understood that I
wished to make a long stay among the Kamus, which
he thought was unsafe for me. Of course, I had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>complaint to make of the king, who had been most
gracious. I submitted to their decision, and would
return home. But my arrangements required my return
to the Kamu villages, where I had left my men
and my goods, and would be detained there till my
messengers should return from Chiengmai—which, he
said, was all right. Since the responsibility had been
put on the king, and the adverse decision had been
based solely on the danger to my personal health and
safety, I thought it unwise to raise the question of
native assistants, and so felt free to leave these on
the ground to teach the new believers, as, indeed, I
felt under obligation to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thanking M. Luce for all his personal kindness, I
begged to take my leave of him then, so that I might
start on my return the next morning. But he evidently
was not satisfied with his own part in the matter,
and wished to make some personal amends to
soothe my disappointment. He hoped I would not
leave in the morning, but would remain till Monday,
and give him the pleasure of a dinner with me and M.
Grant on Sunday night. I hoped he would still excuse
me, since, if I remained, that would be our time
for public worship. “Then,” said he, “we shall be
pleased to have you on Saturday night; and if you
are not ready now to give an affirmative reply, I hope
you will so arrange it as to notify my secretary in the
morning.” Notwithstanding his evident disingenuousness
in trying to shift the responsibility for his
own acts to another, there was no reason for making
it a personal matter; and it would be impolitic to leave
apparently angry. So I decided to remain till Monday,
and accepted the invitation for Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c009'>I feared there would be great constraint on both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>sides at the dinner; but in this I was agreeably disappointed.
That very day a long telegram had arrived,
reporting the declaration of war with Spain,
and the particulars of the great naval victory of
Manila Bay. On my arrival at his house, M. Luce
handed me a full translation of these into English,
which he had had made for me. They were much surprised
at the victory, for they thought the Spanish
navy much larger and stronger than ours; and they
were high in their praise of the victors. We really
had a delightful time. After dinner our host and M.
Grant both laid themselves out to show me beautiful
maps and pictures. M. Luce invited me to call on
Monday morning, and he would send a long telegram
to my wife without charge. This he did, and we all
parted friends. The departure on the 16th, my seventieth
birthday, was not as joyful as I had hoped.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my return to Mûang Sai, I found that my carriers
had been delayed by sore feet and sickness. I
could not leave till they came, for fear of missing
them and causing further complications. So my long
trip home was thrown into the middle of a very rainy
season. I had to apologize as best I could to the new
converts for the change in my plan to remain with
them. But they were glad to have our elders stay and
teach them. If that shady tree on the little hill at
Mûang Sai could speak, it would tell of much anxious
prayer on leaving the Christians and starting on the
long journey before me. My Ebenezer was left on that
tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>That journey was altogether the worst I ever had.
I did not reach home till August 6th, after the longest
tour I had ever taken. M. Luce’s telegram had prepared
my family and friends for my changed plans.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>A few lines must close the history of the work
among the Kamus. In December the three evangelists
returned with a most encouraging report. The converts
had remained firm, and others were waiting to
join them. The next season a native minister was
sent to them. In 1903 the mission ventured to send
two of our younger men, Dr. Campbell and Mr. Mackay.
to Mûang Sai, to visit the Christians, and respond to a
pressing call to extend the work. Imagine their surprise
on reaching Mûang Sai to find that the local
commissioner had received orders to forbid our missionaries
to visit the Christian community, or to hold
any religious service with them, on penalty of being
conducted out of the country, by force if necessary.
The command was so imperative that the Commissioner
dared not disobey. He begged them for his sake
to return peaceably. No effort has been made since
to reach the Christians at Mûang Sai, or to extend
the work.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered that a few members of the
Chieng Sên church—never more than half a dozen
families—lived on the east bank of the Mê Kōng, in
French territory. So objectionable was the very presence
of a missionary making a few days’ visit among
his flock, that it was regarded of sufficient importance
to warrant an official protest from the authorities at
Lūang Prabāng, sent through the Governor General
of Hanoi, and the United States Minister at Bangkok.
Complaint was made of a visit made by the Rev. ——,
who had exhibited Scripture pictures and distributed
books among the people—which was so contrary to
their policy that they forbade the Roman Catholic
missionaries from working in their territory. They
begged that the thing be not repeated! For the credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>of the French authorities I should have been glad to
suppress the latter part of this story. But, on the
other hand, I think it should be known, in order that
it may become a burden on the prayers of the Christian
world of all denominations, that God’s providence
may open the whole peninsula of Indo-China to the
preaching of the Gospel.</p>

  <h2 id='ch35' class='c010'>XXXV<br /> <br />CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>My advancing age suggests the wisdom of not
attempting to continue this personal narrative
beyond the account just given of my
last long missionary tour. I may venture to add,
however, by way of conclusion, a few suggestions and
criticisms concerning the work of our mission as a
whole, and briefly notice a few of the more important
personalities and events of these later years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Special prominence has been given throughout to
the evangelistic work, as being the foundation of all
other missionary work. A Christian Church and a
Christian constituency must be the first aim in all missions.
In this we have not been unsuccessful. Our
ideals, it is true, have not been realized. We have
not witnessed among the Siamese or the Lāo any racial
movement towards Christianity; nor have there been
any great revivals resulting in large accessions to the
church. Both of these we hope for in the not far
distant future. Yet the uniform, healthful growth of
the church, as distinguished from spasmodic or sporadic
increase, has been most gratifying. Seldom does
a week pass without accessions to some of our
churches.</p>

<p class='c009'>An adult membership of four thousand is a good
foundation. And it must never be forgotten that the
roll of church-membership is a very inadequate index
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>of the real influence and power of a mission. In addition
to a much larger constituency of adherents, there
is our large roll of non-communing members, the hope
of the future church. And signs of most hopeful
promise have appeared within the present year. The
growth of the Chieng Rāi church during that time has
been surpassed only by the results of Dr. Campbell’s
recent tours, amounting to eighty accessions within a
few weeks. The supporters of our missions have every
cause for gratitude, and a call for earnest, effectual
prayer in their behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>A review of our evangelistic work suggests one or
two criticisms. On one line at least, with a smaller
amount of hard work done by the missionary himself,
we might have accomplished more, might now be better
prepared for advanced work, and the native church
might be better able to stand alone, if we had addressed
our efforts more steadily to the development
and use of native assistance. While we have not had
the material of well educated young men out of which
to form a theological seminary and to furnish a fully
equipped native ministry, we have not used, to the
extent to which we should have used it, the material
which was available. For a mission as old as ours, we
must confess that in this most important matter we
are very backward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The delay in starting our school for boys was not
our fault; it was inevitable. The Lāo rulers of the
earlier years were absolutely indifferent to all education,
and were positively jealous of any that was given
by the mission. But as the church began to increase,
we had accessions of men trained in the Buddhist
priesthood. Some of these were among the best educated
men in the country. They understood—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>young men even from mission schools could not be
expected to understand—the religion, the modes of
thought, the needs of their own people, and how to
reach them. Their education, however deficient,
brought them many compensations. They form the
class from which nearly all of our evangelists have
been drawn. When such men have been drilled in
the Scriptures, their Buddhistic knowledge makes them
the very best men for successful work among their
countrymen. They visit and sleep in the homes of
their people, and are one with them. The missionary
in his work must rely largely on their judgment and
advice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must not be understood that we have not taught
these men or used them. A great deal of labour has
been spent in training them; very much in the same
way in which in American churches, a generation ago,
busy pastors trained up young men to be some of our
best ministers. The criticism I make—and in it I
believe all my colleagues will concur—is that we have
not made as much of them as we should have done.
No doubt there have been difficulties in the way. Their
families must somehow be provided for during the
process. The native churches were not strong enough
to undertake their support. We were warned that to
aid them with foreign funds would make the churches
mercenary. What the missionary himself sometimes
did to eke out their subsistence was irregular and
difficult, and often unsatisfactory. But the labourer
is worthy of his hire. Hungry mouths must be fed.
The Board and the churches at home do not begrudge
a thousand dollars or more to support a missionary in
the field. Should they begrudge the same amount
spent upon half a dozen men who will treble or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>quadruple the missionary’s work and his influence?
In any business it is poor policy to employ a high-salaried
foreman, and then not furnish him cheaper
men to do that which unskilled labour can accomplish
better than he.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this matter, as in some others, we might have
learned valuable lessons from our nearest missionary
neighbours in Burma, even though the conditions of
our work have been in many respects very different
from theirs. Making all allowance for our conditions,
I frankly confess that our greatest mistake has
probably been in doing too much of the work ourselves,
instead of training others to do it, and working
through them. This conviction, however, must not
in the least lead us to relax our efforts in the line
of general education. For the ultimate establishment
of the church, and to meet the demands of the age,
we must have workmen thoroughly equipped. Till
that time comes, we must, as we should more fully
have done hitherto, rely on whatever good working
material we find ready to hand.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>With regard to plans and methods of work, another
thought suggests itself. In a business organized
as ours is, where the majority in the Annual Meeting
has absolute power, it is difficult to avoid the appearance—and
sometimes the reality—of a vacillating
policy. New stations are established, and missionaries
are located by the ballot of the mission there
assembled. From year to year the personnel of the
mission is constantly changing by reason of furloughs,
breakdown of health, and necessary removals. We
make our disposition of forces at one meeting, and at
the next an entirely new disposition has become necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>A family has been left alone without a physician
or associate. Missionary enthusiasm, or an
earnest minority interested in a particular field or a
particular cause, may initiate a policy which a subsequent
majority may be unable to sanction, or which
it may be found difficult or impossible to carry out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, as between the policy of maintaining one
strong central station, and that of maintaining several
smaller ones in different parts of the country, it
is often difficult to decide. With the aim originally
of establishing the Gospel in all the states under
Siamese rule, we seem to have been led to adopt the
latter policy. Through God’s blessing on evangelistic
tours, in Lampūn and in the frontier provinces of
the north, there grew up churches which called for
missionary oversight. The famine in Prê summoned
us thither; and to secure the work then done, a missionary
in residence was needed. Though no church
had been formed in Nān, yet our tours had opened
the way to one, and the importance of the province
and its distance from our centre demanded a station.
In every case these stations were opened with the cordial
approval of the mission and of the Board at
home. Yet it has been difficult to keep them all
manned, as has been specially true in the case of Prê—and
there to the great detriment of the work. It
is easy to say now that a strong central policy might
have been better. And that criticism would probably
hit me harder than anyone else, for I have sanctioned
the establishment of every one of those stations.
It is possible that a more centralized organization
might have accomplished more toward the education
of native workers—the point last under discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>With reference to the establishment of stations in
the north beyond the frontier of Siam, there was not
until recently absolute unanimity in the mission. But
that was not from any diversity of opinion as regards
the question in itself, but because a sister denomination
had established itself there. There has
never been reasonable ground for doubt that the language
and race of the ruling class, and of the population
of the plains would naturally assign them to
the Lāo mission. And no other mission is so well
equipped for working that field. A Lāo Inland Mission,
somewhat on the plan of the China Inland Mission,
would be an ideal scheme for reaching the whole
of the Tai-speaking peoples of the north and northeast
under English and French and Chinese rule. The
obligation to carry the Gospel to those peoples should
rest heavily on the conscience of the Christian Church,
and on our Church in particular. Who will volunteer
to be the leaders?</p>

<p class='c009'>It has already been noticed that in our educational
work the Girls’ School had the precedence in time, and
possibly in importance. Boys did at least learn to
read and write in the monasteries. At the time of
our arrival in Chiengmai, only two women in the
province could read. The Chiengmai Girls’ School
has had a wide educational influence throughout the
north, and to-day our Girls’ Schools have practically
no competitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Phraner Memorial School for small children,
in connection with the First Church, Chiengmai, under
Mrs. Campbell’s direction, is preparing material
both for High Schools and for the College. We have
good schools for girls in Lakawn, Nān, and Chieng
Rāi; and parochial mixed schools in most of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>country churches and out-stations. The young women
who have been engaged in this department, and many
self-sacrificing married women, have great reason to
rejoice over the work accomplished. No greater work
can be done than that of educating the wives and
mothers of the church and the land. Educated Christian
men are greatly handicapped when consorted
with illiterate and superstitious wives. Without a
Christian wife and mother there can be no Christian
family, the foundation both of the church and of
the Christian State.</p>

<p class='c009'>On a recent visit to Chiengmai, Princess Dārā Ratsami—one
of the wives of His late Majesty of Siam,
and daughter of Prince Intanon of Chiengmai and his
wife, the Princess Tipakēsawn, often mentioned in the
preceding narrative—was much interested in the Girls’
School, and was pleased to name it the Phra Rajchayar
School, after herself—using therefor her title,
and not her personal name.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mission had been founded twenty years before
it had, and almost before it could have had, a School
for Boys. It is the intention of the mission to make
of this school—the Prince Royal College—the future
Christian College. Similar schools have been established
in the other stations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since the Siamese government assumed control in
the North, it has manifested a laudable zeal in establishing
schools, in which, however, the Siamese language
alone is taught. His Majesty is most fortunate
in having such an able and progressive representative
in the North as the present High Commissioner, Chow
Prayā Surasīh Visithasakdī. And the country is no
less fortunate in having a ruler whose high personal
character and wise administration command the confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>and respect of all classes. He is interested
in educating the people, and in everything that advances
the interests of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>I regard the educational question as the great question
now before the mission. The existence of the
Siamese schools greatly emphasizes the importance
of our own work, and the necessity of maintaining a
high standard and a strong teaching force in Siamese,
English, mathematics, and the sciences. Their schools
then will be tributary to ours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ultimate prevalence of the Siamese language
in all the provinces under Siamese rule, has been inevitable
from the start. All governments realize the
importance of a uniform language in unifying a people,
and have no interest whatever in perpetuating a
provincial dialect. The Siamese, in fact, look down
with a kind of disdain upon the Lāo speech, and use
it only as a temporary necessity during the period of
transition. And the Siamese is really the richer of
the two by reason of its large borrowing from the
Pali, the better scholarship behind it, and its closer
connection with the outside world.</p>

<p class='c009'>These two forms of the Tai speech—with a common
idiom, and with the great body of words in both
identical, or differing only in vocal inflection—have
been kept apart chiefly by the fact that they have different
written characters. All of the Lāo women and
children, and two-thirds of the men had to be taught
to read, whichever character were adopted; and they
could have learned the one form quite as easily as the
other. Had the mission adopted the Siamese character
from the start, it would now be master of the
educational situation, working on a uniform scheme
with the Siamese Educational Department. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>the Siamese language in our schools would have
been a distinct attraction toward education and
toward Christianity. And thus there would have
been available for the North the labours of two or
more generations of able workers in the southern
mission, from which so far the Lāo church has been
mostly cut off. The whole Bible would have been accessible
from the first; whereas now nearly half of it
remains still untranslated into the Lāo. If the future
needs of the Siamese provinces alone were to be considered,
it might even be doubted whether it were
worth while to complete the translation. When the
monks, in their studies and teaching, adopt the
Siamese, as it is now the intention of the government
to have them do, Lāo books will soon be without readers
throughout Siam. When for the young a choice
is possible in the matter of such a transcendent instrument
of thought and culture as language, all surely
would wish their training to be in that one which has
in it the promise of the future. These words are
written in no idle criticism of the past, and in no
captious spirit regarding the present; but with full
sense of the gravity of the decision which confronts
the mission in shaping its educational policy for those
who henceforth are to be Siamese.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, Lāo type and books in the Lāo dialect
are needed, not merely for the present generation of
older people who cannot or will not learn a new character,
but also for the instruction and Christianization
of that much larger mass of Lāo folk beyond the
frontier of Siam as revealed by recent explorations.
Removed, as these are, entirely from the political and
cultural influence of Siam, and divided up under the
jurisdiction of three great nations of diverse and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>alien speech, it is inconceivable that the Siamese
should ever win the ascendency over them. Nor has
either of these nations any immediate and pressing
incentive toward unifying the speech of its provincials,
such as has actuated Siam in this matter. If the
field of the Lāo mission is to be extended to include
these “regions beyond”—as we all hope that it soon
may be—Lāo speech will inevitably be the medium of
all its work there. Then all that so far has been accomplished
in the way of translation, writing, and
printing in the Lāo tongue, will be so much invaluable
capital to be turned over to the newer enterprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>As regards the medical department of the mission,
the Lāo field has been an ideal one for its operation
and for demonstration of its results. When the field
was virtually closed to the simple Gospel, the missionary
physician found everywhere an exalted, not
to say exaggerated, idea of the efficacy of foreign medicine,
and a warm welcome for himself. Dr. Cheek,
who virtually founded our regular medical work among
the Lāo, had been on the field but a short time when
he reported thirteen thousand patients treated in one
year. Probably no subsequent physician has had such
absolute control of the situation as he had, so long as
he gave his time and talents to his calling. But even
the layman finds his medical chest an invaluable adjunct
to his evangelistic work, as we have had frequent
occasion to notice. We are devoutly thankful
for—we might almost envy—the influence that our
medical missionaries have exerted in the civilization
and the Christianization of the Lāo tribes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somewhat of the present status and importance of
the medical mission may be judged from the following
facts: Dr. J. W. McKean’s projected Leper Asylum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>is the largest charitable institution ever planned in
the kingdom. The new Overbrook Hospital in Chieng
Rāi, the generous gift of the Gest family of Overbrook,
Pennsylvania, is the finest building in the mission.
The Charles T. Van Santvoord Hospital in Lakawn
is another similar gift. Native physicians, trained as
far as present opportunities permit in Western surgery
and medicine, are now maintained at certain posts by
the Siamese government. And especially the work of
Dr. Arthur Kerr, the government physician in Chiengmai,
and his unremitting kindness to the mission, are
deeply appreciated by us all.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot close these remarks without making special
reference to the work of my old friend and
classmate and early associate in the mission, Dr.
Jonathan Wilson. In addition to his other most
valuable labours, he spent years of loving and devoted
service in the preparation of hymns for Lāo worship,
Which will mould and lead the spiritual life of this
people for years to come. The Lāo are lovers of
music. Many of them have received much of their religious
instruction through the use of these hymns.
His influence in the Lāo church may be compared to
that of Watts and Wesley for the English race.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>Our long isolation as a mission has enabled us to
appreciate the coming to us in late years of a number
of distinguished visitors, who have greatly encouraged
and strengthened us.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Annual Meeting in December, 1900, we were
favoured with a visit from our United States Minister,
Hon. Hamilton King, and his two daughters. Referring
to his visit, the “Lāo Quarterly Letter” said:
“His addresses to the missionaries and native ministers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>and elders of the Presbytery were much appreciated,
and our large church building was crowded on
two successive Sabbaths to hear his eloquent words
of encouragement to native Christians, and his warm
commendation of Christianity to non-Christians. It
has been said that one of the best things which a
United States Minister can take to a non-Christian
land is a good Christian home. And this is just what
Mr. King has brought to Siam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Annual Meeting of the following year, in
Lakawn, we received the first official visit we ever had
from one of the Secretaries of our Board, in the person
of Rev. Arthur J. Brown, D.D., accompanied by his
good wife. The importance of these secretarial visits
to distant missions can hardly be overestimated. It is
impossible to legislate intelligently for a constituency
twelve thousand miles away. No amount of writing
can give the varied kinds of information necessary
for a full understanding of the people, the missionaries,
their surroundings, and the needs of the field,
which a single visit will convey. Then, too, there are
questions of administration and mission polity, requiring
settlement in the home Board, which can
with difficulty be understood through correspondence.
Dr. Brown’s official visit was most helpful, as also
his words of encouragement, his sermons and addresses.
The pleasure derived from the personal visits
of Dr. and Mrs. Brown to various members of the
Mission will always linger in our memories.</p>

<p>HIS MAJESTY, MAHĀ VAJIRAVUDH, KING OF SIAM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Another notable visit to Chiengmai was that of
the Crown Prince of Siam, now His Majesty Mahā
Vajiravudh, in the winter of 1905-6. On this visit His
Royal Highness very graciously accepted the invitation
of the mission to lay the corner stone of the William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Allen Butler Hall, the recitation hall of the new
Boys’ School. On that occasion he delivered an address,
of which the following is a translation:</p>

<p class='c024'>“Ladies and Gentlemen:—I have listened with great
pleasure to the complimentary remarks which have just been
made. I regard them as indisputable evidence of your
friendship for the whole Kingdom of Siam.</p>

<p class='c027'>“During my visit to the United States, the American
people were pleased to give me a most enthusiastic welcome.
I may mention particularly the sumptuous banquet with
which your Board of Foreign Missions honoured me. I
perceived clearly that the American people received me
whole-heartedly and not perfunctorily. This also made
it evident to me that the American people have a sincere
friendship for the Kingdom of Siam. Of this fact I was
profoundly convinced, and I certainly shall not soon forget
my visit to the United States.</p>

<p class='c027'>“This being so, I feel compelled to reciprocate this kindness
to the full extent of my ability. As my Royal Grandfather
and my Royal Father have befriended the missionaries,
so I trust that I too shall have opportunity, on
proper occasions, to assist them to the limits of my power.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Your invitation to me to-day to lay the corner stone
of your new School Building, is another evidence of your
friendship and goodwill toward Siam. I have full confidence
that you will make every endeavour to teach the
students to use their knowledge for the welfare of their
country. Therefore I take great pleasure in complying with
your request, and I invoke a rich blessing on this new institution.
May it prosper and fulfil the highest expectations
of its founders!”</p>

<p class='c025'>In response to a request from the Principal that he
would name the new school, His Royal Highness sent
the following reply:</p>

<div class='c028'>“<span class='sc'>Chiengmai</span>, January 2d, 1906.</div>

<p class='c027'>“I have great pleasure in naming the new school, the
foundation stone of which I have just laid, The Prince
Royal’s College. May this School which I have so named,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>be prosperous, and realize all that its well-wishers hope for
it. May it long flourish, and remain a worthy monument of
the enterprise of the American Presbyterian Church of
Chiengmai. This is the wish of their sincere friend,</p>
<div class='c029'>“<span class='sc'>Vajiravudh</span>.”</div>

<p class='c025'>Little did we then think that His Royal Highness
would so soon be called to fill the high office left
vacant by the lamented death of his distinguished
father, King Chulalangkorn, which occurred October
22d, 1910.</p>

<p class='c009'>In December, 1908, Mrs. McGilvary’s brother, Professor
Cornelius B. Bradley of the University of California,
while on a visit to the land of his birth and
of his father’s labours, paid us a visit in the North.
He was present at our Annual Meeting in Lakawn,
and on Sunday preached the Communion sermon, and
again in Chiengmai. It was to the astonishment of all
who heard him, both natives and foreigners, that he
could converse fluently and flawlessly, and could so
preach, after an absence of thirty-six years. It was
upon this visit to Siam, that he made a special study
and translation of the Sukhōthai Stone—the earliest
known monument of the Siamese language.</p>

<p class='c009'>In company with Professor Bradley came Mr. William
McClusky, a business man, on a visit to his
daughter, Mrs. M. B. Palmer. The significance of this
visit lies in the fact that Mr. McClusky has remained
among us, and has identified himself with the work of
the mission, endearing himself to all.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>In 1905 Mrs. McGilvary returned to the United
States for a much-needed change. I remained on the
field until 1906, when I was cabled for on account
of the very serious state of her health. I found her
very low, and my visit was devoted to the restoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>of her health. In the autumn she was sufficiently recovered
to make our return possible, and the voyage
was undertaken in compliance with her own ardent
wish. She was greatly benefited by the sea-voyage, and
since her return her health has been fully restored.</p>

<p class='c009'>On May 16th, 1908, my daughter, Mrs. William Harris,
gave a dinner in honour of my eightieth birthday,
at which all our missionary and European friends in
Chiengmai were guests. Dr. McKean expressed the
congratulations of my friends in an address, from
which I quote the following: “Eighty years of age,
sir, but not eighty years old! We do not associate
the term old age with you, for you seem to have drunk
of the fount of perpetual youth.” But the sentiment
to which I most heartily subscribe is the following:
“There is a common maxim among men to which
we all readily assent; namely, that no man is able to
do his best work in the world without having received
from God that best of all temporal gifts, a helpmeet
for him. We most heartily congratulate you
that, early in your life in Siam, Mrs. McGilvary was
made a partner in this great life-work. And no one
knows so well as yourself how large a part she has
had in making possible much of the strenuous work
that you have done. To her, likewise, we offer on this
happy occasion our hearty congratulations and our
fervent wishes for an ever-brightening future!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On December 6th, 1910, Mrs. McGilvary and I celebrated
our Golden Wedding. As this occurred during
the Annual Meeting of the Mission, most of our missionary
friends, as well as our friends of the foreign
colony, were present. It was a matter of great regret,
however, that Dr. Wilson, who was present at
the wedding fifty years before, was too feeble to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>to Chiengmai on this occasion. The many beautiful
gifts received were another token of the loving regard
of our friends and dear ones in this and in the homeland.
Among the many letters and telegrams received
was a cablegram from our children in America.
“It was like a hand-clasp and a whisper of
love flashed around the world.” Dr. Arthur J. Brown,
speaking for himself and the members of the Board of
Foreign Missions, wrote: “We greatly rejoice in your
long and conspicuously devoted and influential service
for the Lāo people. We share the veneration and love
with which we know you are regarded by the people
among whom your lives have been spent, and by the
missionaries with whom you have been so closely associated.
It would be a joy if we could join the relatives
and friends who will be with you on that happy
day in December. We invoke God’s richest blessings
on you both. Mrs. Brown and all my colleagues
in the office unite with the members of the Board in
loving congratulations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most valued of these messages came from
H. R. H. Prince Damrong, Minister of the Interior:
“I just learn from the local papers of the celebration
of your Golden Wedding. I wish you and Mrs. McGilvary
to accept my sincere congratulations and best
wishes that you both may be spared to continue your
great work for many more years. Damrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our good friend, H. E. Prayā Surasīh Visithsakdī,
High Commissioner for the Northwestern Provinces,
brought his congratulations in person, presenting Mrs.
McGilvary with a very rare old Siamese bowl of inlaid
work of silver and gold.</p>

<div id='i428'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>DR. AND MRS. McGILVARY FIFTY YEARS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'>From the native church in Chieng Rāi a message in
Lāo was received, of which the following is a translation:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>“The Chieng Rāi Christians invoke Divine blessings
on the Father-Teacher and Mother-Teacher McGilvary,
who are by us more beloved than gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We were deeply touched by a most unexpected
demonstration of the Chiengmai Christians, who assembled
at our home, and with many expressions of
loving esteem and gratitude presented us with a silver
tray, designed by themselves, on which were represented
in relief the progress of the city in these fifty
years: on one end the old bridge, on the other the
new bridge just completed; on the two sides, the rest-house
we occupied upon our arrival in Chiengmai, and
our present home. The inscription, in Lāo, reads:
“1867-1910. The Christian people of Chiengmai to
Father-Teacher and Mother-Teacher McGilvary, in
memory of your having brought the Good News of
Christ, forty-three years ago.”—It makes one feel very
humble to quote such expressions from our colleagues
and friends. But it would not be in human nature
to fail to appreciate them.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I would not close this life-story without expressing,
on behalf of my wife and myself, our heartfelt
gratitude to our friends, native and foreign, for the
great kindness shown us in our intercourse with them
during these long years; and, above all, our devout
gratitude to the Giver of all good, for sparing so long
our lives, and crowning them with such rich blessings.
Of these the greatest has been in permitting us
to lay the foundations, and to witness the steady
growth of the Church of Christ in Northern Siam.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
